Gerrit Cole,SP,Yankees,33.0,33.0,212.1,48.0,326.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,2.5,0.89,13.82,12.0,12.0,77.0,19.0,111.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.81,0.95,12.97,"After missing out on signing him as their 2008 first-round draftee, then falling short of trading for him following the 2017 campaign, the Yankees have finally landed Cole, awarding him the largest free-agent contract by any pitcher in baseball history. In fitting him for pinstripes, the Yankees offer Cole one of the game's most favorable environments, sporting an elite offense and bullpen as well as one of the most analytically driven staffs -- something that surely appealed to the right-hander. But there's a drawback in the form of Yankee Stadium. With its short porch in right field, it's a much more hitting-friendly ballpark than either of the previous two he called home, which could lead to a small increase in his ERA. That shouldn't preclude him from being the first pitcher off the board in all fantasy leagues, though, being that his 17% swing-and-miss rate last season was the highest by any qualified pitcher in the 18 years for which that data exists. Cole is a pitcher at his peak. Draft accordingly."
Jacob deGrom,SP,Mets,32.0,32.0,204.0,44.0,255.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.43,0.97,11.25,12.0,12.0,76.0,18.0,88.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.84,1.04,10.42,"Who needs wins? Now the back-to-back National League Cy Young award recipient, deGrom won no more than 11 times in either year, showing that most everyone recognizes the folly of individual pitcher wins nowadays. Yes, they're a category in rotisserie leagues, and yes, they're worth five points in ESPN's standard points leagues. That said, he was a top-six finisher in both formats in each of the past two seasons regardless, and he's coming off a 2019 second half in which he went 10-of-14 in quality starts with seven wins, a 1.44 ERA, a 0.83 WHIP and a 33% strikeout rate. There's no question that deGrom is an ace at the top of his game, with no imminent sign of a decline coming despite his 31 years of age. Frankly, he probably would be the first pitcher off every 2020 draft board if not for that win-potential disparity as well as the 39-K difference (using 2018-19 combined numbers) between him and Gerrit Cole."
Justin Verlander,SP,Astros,34.0,34.0,223.0,42.0,300.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,2.62,0.81,12.11,10.0,10.0,63.0,13.0,81.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.86,0.89,11.57,"Verlander is a great example of being both lucky and good. The 2019 AL Cy Young winner posted an outstanding 30.5% K-BB. However, he also gave up 36 homers, third most in the league, although it was only the fifth most in terms of HR/PA. Low walks with a fortunate hit rate limited base runners and the damage against him. Verlander's BABIP was .218 -- obviously lucky -- but part of the reason that number was so low is that the homers he gave up aren't part of the BABIP formula. In previous seasons, some of those blasts would have been doubles and triples, and hence included. Regardless, Verlander remains one of the top hurlers in the league and isn't showing any of the signs of decline traditionally associated with someone entering his age-37 season."
Max Scherzer,SP,Nationals,27.0,27.0,172.1,33.0,243.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.92,1.03,12.69,11.0,11.0,70.0,15.0,91.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.21,1.01,11.7,"For the first time in seven seasons, Scherzer fell short of either 30 starts or 200 innings pitched in 2019, exhibiting the first disconcerting signs of injury in his career. He made IL trips for a back strain (July) and a mild rhomboid strain (July/August) totaling 43 days lost, and most notably had his World Series Game 5 start pushed back because of neck spasms. Between these ailments and including the postseason, Scherzer's ERA was 3.82 and his WHIP 1.18. He also averaged 5.5 innings and 95.8 pitches per start -- all very good numbers, but considerably short of the 2.71/0.93/6.7/103.3 he averaged in his first four seasons with the Nationals. Still, he toughed it out for long enough to earn his fourth consecutive top-three and seventh consecutive top-five finish in NL Cy Young balloting, and showed no decline relative to his 2015-18 form in terms of his K-rate or average fastball velocity in those 13 season-concluding starts. On a per-start basis, Scherzer makes nearly as good a case as anyone to be picked first at his position. The only thing that should hold you back is the heightened risk that he might not play a full season."
Walker Buehler,SP,Dodgers,30.0,30.0,182.1,37.0,215.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.26,1.04,10.61,12.0,12.0,71.0,17.0,78.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.68,1.1,9.89,"Buehler's career is off to a sparkling start, and if the Dodgers are ready to release the reins on their now-25-year-old right-hander, he might be ready to claim an NL Cy Young award in the best-case scenario. He sports a brilliant combination of elite stuff (with four plus-pitches: four-seam fastball, cutter, sinker and slider -- and a curveball that is pretty darned good, too) and control (his 5.0% walk rate was 10th-best and 5.8 K:BB seventh-best among qualifiers in 2019). The Dodgers pitched him on greater than five days of rest five times in 30 starts last season, and have allowed him to exceed 100 pitches in only 15 of 59 career starts (postseason included). Even with these limitations, Buehler managed a No. 34 overall finish on the Player Rater and was 25th in scoring in points-based leagues. On a per-outing basis, he might challenge for the honor of best pitcher in fantasy, so do don't let him slip beyond the first couple of dozen picks in your draft."
Stephen Strasburg,SP,Nationals,33.0,33.0,209.0,56.0,251.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.32,1.04,10.81,11.0,11.0,67.0,19.0,75.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.63,1.15,10.07,"In his age-30 and 10th big league season, Strasburg set personal bests with 18 wins and 251 strikeouts, and led the National League with 209 innings pitched, and avoided the injured list for only the second time in a full year (also 2014). Despite slightly declining velocity, he maintained top-10-fantasy-starter ratios almost across the board, largely because he leaned increasingly on what was one of the game's most productive curveballs. After such a successful season culminating in a World Series title and a new, multiyear contract extension, Strasburg might have inflated expectations in fantasy entering 2020. His health history, though, appears to be keeping them reasonable in early drafts: A clear top-10 starter, but one in the back rather than front end of it."
Jack Flaherty,SP,Cardinals,33.0,33.0,196.1,55.0,231.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.75,0.97,10.59,12.0,12.0,71.0,23.0,77.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.68,1.11,9.76,"Flaherty's final 16 regular-season starts last season were a thing of beauty: 14 quality starts, a 0.93 ERA, a 0.70 WHIP, a .139 BAA and a 33.3% strikeout rate. While nearly everything seemed to break in the right-hander's favor during that span (except run support, as he somehow managed only seven wins and had three quality-start losses), credit him for his skills bump. This included a boost in average fastball velocity (94.3 mph, compared to 93.5 in his big league career before it), a drop of more than 2% in his walk rate, and an increase in ground balls. Flaherty, thanks to his elite slider and now-elite four-seam fastball, Flaherty can legitimately claim to be a top-10 fantasy starting pitcher in all formats. Just don't chase those second-half numbers exclusively, as some regression is due."
Shane Bieber,SP,Indians,34.0,33.0,214.1,40.0,259.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.28,1.05,10.88,12.0,12.0,74.0,13.0,83.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.65,1.11,10.09,"Control has always been Bieber's strong suit -- he has never walked even 5% of the hitters he has faced at any professional stop in any year -- and last season he added polish to his curveball and slider coupled with a greater reliance upon each, fueling a massive breakthrough. He finished tied for third in quality starts (24), third in strikeouts (259), 11th in WHIP (1.05) and 15th in ERA (3.28), and maintained the elite performance through the full 162, with a 3.09 second-half ERA in 15 starts. The one weakness was an inability to limit hard contact, as his 90.4 mph average exit velocity and 43.1% hard contact rates allowed, per Statcast data, ranked in the bottom half of baseball. Bieber's skill set mandates maintaining elite control, but his track record shows he can do it. Consider him a borderline top-10 fantasy starter, though he'd be hard-pressed to contend for the position's top spot."
Mike Clevinger,SP,Indians,21.0,21.0,126.0,37.0,169.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.71,1.06,12.07,12.0,12.0,72.0,25.0,85.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.13,1.14,10.63,"An upper-back strain at the onset of the regular season threatened to ruin Clevinger's 2019, but within three weeks of his healthy return, he recaptured his form as one of the game's best up-and-coming hurlers. In 17 starts from July 1 forward, he had 12 wins, 12 quality starts, a 2.17 ERA and 32.5% strikeout rate, all top-seven numbers in all of baseball during that span. The speedy rebound eases some of the injury worry entering 2020, and Clevinger's combination of mid-to-high-90s fastball and elite slider assures he'll continue to be one of the better sources of strikeouts and low ERA. Remember: Almost every starting pitcher these days faces some sort of volume-related question, and Clevinger's is really no greater than most, while his talent rivals that of anyone outside the top five at his position. Draft accordingly."
Clayton Kershaw,SP,Dodgers,29.0,28.0,178.1,41.0,189.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.08,1.04,9.54,11.0,11.0,69.0,14.0,70.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.78,1.09,9.13,"Considering his hefty career workload and dalliances with back woes, Kershaw will likely carry the ""health risk"" label for the rest of his career. That said, the veteran southpaw's 514 2/3 innings pitched since 2017 ranks a respectable 16th among qualified starters. Last season, Kershaw recovered from early-season shoulder soreness to pitch 178 1/3 solid frames, improving his strikeout rate while lowering his hard-hit clip from 2018. However, Kershaw also allowed a career-high 28 homers, resulting in a 3.03 ERA -- his first season north of 3.00 since his rookie campaign. His estimators were also higher than any since early in his career. Kershaw might no longer be the best pitcher on the planet, but he can still be the best pitcher on a fantasy roster -- one of the top dozen or so -- even with a reduced workload."
Patrick Corbin,SP,Nationals,33.0,33.0,202.0,70.0,238.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.25,1.18,10.6,12.0,12.0,71.0,24.0,81.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.93,1.27,10.27,"Corbin enjoyed a second consecutive productive season as a retooled pitcher. He always had a good fastball and a great slider, but adding a curveball to give him two different shapes to his breaking ball has taken his game to a new level. It has allowed him to go deeper into games, leaving him less exposed to the penalty pitchers face when they are up against a lineup for the third time with a limited repertoire. The expanded repertoire also has made it tougher for righties to hit him; he had a 1.40 WHIP and an 11 K-BB% against them from 2012-17 and has a 1.11 WHIP with a 21 K-BB% the past two seasons. He would front many rotations and could front your fantasy rotation, even if he's only the third-best guy in his real-life rotation."
Charlie Morton,SP,Rays,33.0,33.0,194.2,57.0,240.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.05,1.08,11.1,12.0,12.0,69.0,22.0,80.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.26,1.13,10.43,"Morton followed up the first season in which he made 30 starts by making 33 starts and setting a career high with 194 2/3 innings of work. The issue of durability dogged Morton most of his professional career, but he has bucked the trend and become more durable as he has aged. Tampa Bay did not show much concern for his workload, as it allowed him to work deep into games to give the bullpen as much time off as possible. Morton made the transition from Houston to Tampa Bay easily, since the two organizations have similar pitching philosophies of fastballs up and everything else down or sweeping out of the zone. The only fear with Morton is his body might begin to act its age and fail him as it did early in his career. He is an underrated ace."
Blake Snell,SP,Rays,23.0,23.0,107.0,40.0,147.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.29,1.27,12.36,11.0,11.0,61.0,23.0,80.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.39,1.13,11.8,"Where almost everything went right for Snell during his Cy Young 2018, almost everything went wrong for him in the encore. He made a pair of trips to the injured list, first for a fractured toe, then for an elbow issue that cost him 53 days, and saw his BABIP soar by 102 points, home run/fly ball percentage rise by nearly 5 full percentage points and left-on-base percentage plummet to 71.6, below the league average. Beneath all that, his skills seemed stable: His strikeout rate rose, from 31.6% to 33.3%; he lost scarcely any fastball velocity; and he afforded similarly weak contact rates. FIP tells it all: Snell's rose from 2.95 to 3.32, with the latter a better indication of true talent, accounting for expected regression to the mean. Snell remains capable of a top-10 fantasy starter's season, though his year-over-year innings totals suggest some caution is advised."
Chris Paddack,SP,Padres,26.0,26.0,140.2,31.0,153.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.33,0.98,9.79,11.0,11.0,61.0,11.0,62.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.84,1.03,9.15,"Paddack rode a lights-out spring to a spot in the Padres' Opening Day rotation and posted one of the most electric rookie campaigns we've seen in some time. Among rookies who made at least 20 starts, his 4.94 K-to-walk ratio ranked ninth-best, and his 26.9% strikeout rate was 12th best all time. Paddack's elite changeup, coupled with a plus fastball that can hit the mid-90s, gives him a strong combination that should allow him to match, if not exceed, his 2019 numbers. If there's any limit to his fantasy potential, it's volume. He made only 26 starts and totaled 140 2/3 innings, as the Padres looked to rein him in after he had pitched only 90 innings in 2018 in his first season back from Tommy John surgery. Can he make 30-plus starts and pitch 180-plus innings? It's possible, and the chance of it is worth selecting him among the top 20 starters on your draft board."
Luis Castillo,SP,Reds,32.0,32.0,190.2,79.0,226.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.45,1.14,10.67,12.0,12.0,69.0,28.0,77.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.78,1.23,10.04,"Castillo predictably rebounded in 2019, after a rather unlucky 2018 in terms of both ERA and total strikeouts. In fact, he even stepped up his game by posting a 28.9% strikeout rate that was his highest in any season since he was in rookie ball in 2013. He continued to flash one of the game's most dominating changeups, while boosting his four-seam fastball velocity to 96.5 mph on average, traits that should increase his odds of repeating (or even exceeding) that performance. Castillo has established himself as one of the 20 best starting pitchers in fantasy, regardless of format, and while his hitting-friendly home ballpark (Great American Ball Park) will probably hold him back from reaching the pinnacle at his position, he's a strong investment at a prime age 27 and coming off back-to-back 30-start campaigns."
Josh Hader,RP,Brewers,61.0,0.0,75.2,20.0,138.0,3.0,37.0,6.0,2.62,0.81,16.41,18.0,0.0,24.0,5.0,43.0,1.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,0.79,16.13,"Only the fourth reliever to strike out at least 125 batters in back-to-back seasons (Dellin Betances, Rob Dibble, Dick Radatz), Hader is one of the few relief pitchers whose strikeout totals are so gaudy, he can make up for some of the shortcomings of your fantasy rotation. He's also the most logical choice to close for the Brewers, which is saying something considering their matchup-oriented pitching strategy, meaning that he'll probably cruise to a No. 1 finish among relievers in any format even if he's not a contender for the major league saves lead. If there are any concerns with Hader, it's the hefty amount of work he has had the past two seasons -- he averaged 1.35 innings and 21.5 pitches per outing -- as well as the 15 home runs he surrendered in 2019. Attribute the latter partly to the baseball and partly some bad luck on fly balls, because all of his other skills were beyond elite, and in fact showed some slight signs of improvement. Hader is the rare reliever truly worthy of a top-50 overall pick."
Lucas Giolito,SP,White Sox,29.0,29.0,176.2,57.0,228.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.41,1.06,11.62,12.0,12.0,71.0,24.0,87.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.68,1.11,11.03,"Giolito entered 2019 with an entirely new approach. He ditched a forgettable sinker, cleaned up his delivery while shifting his position on the pitching rubber, and saw a near-2 mph boost in his average four-seam fastball velocity. This helped shape one of the season's biggest breakthrough stories, as he shaved nearly three full runs off his ERA and more than two full runs off his FIP, resulting in a top-16 finish among starting pitchers in both rotisserie and points-based leagues. While the instinct among fantasy baseball managers is to always assume regression from the unexpectedly good, Giolito's adjustments vastly strengthen his repeat prospects. Considering he has long been considered an ace-in-waiting, he has a realistic chance at taking another step forward in 2020. Snatch him up before the top 25 starting pitchers or top 100 overall players are off the board."
Kirby Yates,RP,Padres,60.0,0.0,60.2,13.0,101.0,0.0,41.0,0.0,1.19,0.89,14.98,23.0,0.0,23.0,5.0,35.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,2.35,0.91,13.7,"Going into 2019, Yates was considered a candidate for an in-season deal to a destination where he could set up an established closer. That's still a threat with Yates entering his final season before free agency, but the Padres are on the verge of contending and it's more likely than not that Yates would close for a different team. His stuff isn't dominant, averaging 93.5 mph on his fastball, but he did generate a swinging-strike rate of 16.7%. Yates is essentially a two-pitch guy with his splitter inducing a 17.9% swinging-strike rate. The southpaw uses the fastball a little over 50% of the time but will mix his pitches in all counts, keeping batters off balance. Yates' 36.2% K-BB ranked second only to Josh Hader's 40.8% mark among all pitchers with at least 60 innings. No one is a lock to lead the league in saves, but if forced to guess who might do so, Yates should be on the short list."
Zack Greinke,SP,Astros,33.0,33.0,208.2,30.0,187.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,3.06,0.99,8.07,12.0,12.0,74.0,14.0,69.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.41,1.05,8.39,"Every spring, timid drafters are scared away from Greinke, as his velocity is inevitably down and he gets knocked around. By season's end, someone less risk-averse is generally rewarded with an outstanding campaign. To wit, Greinke's ERA the past three seasons is 3.10 with a sparkling 1.04 WHIP, averaging 206 2/3 innings with 200 punchouts per season. On paper, there's no reason to expect a decline, other than age, as the veteran is 36 years old. Greinke's spin rates are tepid compared to the usual Astros hurlers, but the Houston coaching staff still should be beneficial, helping temper any age-related skills erosion. There will still be a contingent looking to avoid Greinke, preferring to be one year too early. Considering the positive team context and recent performance levels, the better approach is taking the discount, especially for fantasy managers who wait on pitching."
Aaron Nola,SP,Phillies,34.0,34.0,202.1,80.0,229.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.87,1.27,10.19,12.0,12.0,75.0,27.0,80.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.08,1.24,9.6,"After a breakthrough 2018 during which he was baseball's only qualified pitcher to post at least 25% strikeout and 50% ground ball rates as well as a sub-7.5% walk rate, Nola's control regressed to a professional-worst 9.4% in 2019, with it dragging down all of his pertinent fantasy numbers. While he was one of only six pitchers to make at least 34 starts and pitch at least 200 innings, his ERA soared by a run and a half, with his underlying skills suggesting it was a true representation of the performance. In Nola's defense, his average four-seam fastball velocity continued a three-year pattern of increase, his past track record suggests he should be sharper with his control in 2020, and he's one of the more reliable arms from a volume standpoint. He should cruise to a top-20 finish at his position, and if he's looking sharp in the spring, might have a path to top-10 status."
Aroldis Chapman,RP,Yankees,60.0,0.0,57.0,25.0,85.0,3.0,37.0,0.0,2.21,1.11,13.42,16.0,0.0,15.0,5.0,20.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,2.4,1.07,12.0,"For the fifth time in his past six seasons, Chapman managed at least 30 saves, 85 strikeouts and a sub-2.50 ERA in 2019, despite the fact that his average fastball velocity dropped for the third consecutive year. He's no longer the overwhelming power pitcher he was during his prime, but in his defense, a 98.0 mph average four-seam fastball is still awfully tough to hit -- and still a top-three speed in baseball (minimum 500 thrown). Chapman's increasing rate of injury coupled with said velocity drop does threaten his draft stock more than it did, say, two years ago, but he still possesses top-five skills at his position for fantasy. He'll almost assuredly close for one of the best teams in baseball all season, so draft him with confidence in the early-to-mid rounds."
Tyler Glasnow,SP,Rays,12.0,12.0,60.2,14.0,76.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.78,0.89,11.27,10.0,10.0,58.0,20.0,64.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.41,1.1,9.93,"Glasnow was steamrolling his way to one of 2019's biggest breakthroughs, posting a 1.86 ERA, a 0.91 WHIP and a 30.1% K rate in eight starts before succumbing to a forearm strain that cost him almost four whole months. The lengthy absence, coupled with his elite fastball velocity, immediately raised durability questions, which will surely dampen his fantasy potential entering 2020. Glasnow made six September/postseason appearances during which he continued to flash ace-caliber stuff. Bear in mind that his worst two starts did come at Houston's Minute Maid Park, with pitch-tipping concerns raised. Expect as many as 25 starts and 160-175 innings. With that much volume, and his revamped delivery following his mid-2018 trade from the Pirates, he could easily place among the top 20 fantasy starters in any format. Just be forewarned that Glasnow's range of outcomes is among the widest of any SP."
Yu Darvish,SP,Cubs,31.0,31.0,178.2,56.0,229.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,3.98,1.1,11.54,12.0,12.0,66.0,22.0,77.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.36,1.21,10.5,"Darvish's 2019 was a tale of two halves. He found it exceedingly difficult to find the strike zone during the season's first half, posting a 5.01 ERA and a 11.7% walk rate in 18 starts, but suddenly flashed pinpoint control during the second half, posting a 2.76 ERA in 13 starts and walking as few total batters (seven) as he did in his March 30 start alone. So which version is the one to anticipate in 2020? With that level of improvement in his control, Darvish has a legitimate chance to be a top-20 fantasy starter this season, though similarly good luck in the health department would have a lot to say about it. He's a better draft pick now than you might think, and if he slips outside the top 25 on your board, you should pounce!"
Brandon Woodruff,SP,Brewers,23.0,22.0,121.2,30.0,143.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.62,1.14,10.58,12.0,12.0,69.0,21.0,75.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.78,1.19,9.78,"Woodruff was on his way to becoming one of 2019's biggest breakthrough stories before an oblique injury suffered in his July 21 start cost him close to two months on the IL. He was limited to only three appearances and eight total innings (postseason included) the rest of the way. Fortunately, despite the limited sample, his skills after returning looked to be in line with those in his four months of the year, his professional-best 6.1% walk rate being the most significant accomplishment. Further growth for Woodruff will hinge upon more luck in the health department and a narrowing of his 86-point wOBA platoon split, but a shortened season does alleviate some of the workload concerns surrounding him. There's a lot to like here, and if he's throwing darts in spring training, he could merit a top-25 starter selection in any format."
Roberto Osuna,RP,Astros,66.0,0.0,65.0,12.0,73.0,4.0,38.0,0.0,2.63,0.88,10.11,22.0,0.0,22.0,4.0,31.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,2.45,0.91,12.68,"Osuna may not be the first closer off the board or most expensive in an auction, but he's firmly entrenched in the elite tier. Armed with a five-pitch mix more befitting an elite starter than a lockdown closer, Osuna features a 97 mph fastball, slider, changeup, cutter and occasional sinker. In his five-year career, Osuna's ERA has been below 3.00 four times, and he's never had a WHIP over 1.00. A 29% strikeout rate fuels a strong strikeout total despite topping 70 innings pitched just once. Last season, he held the closer job all season while notching an American League-leading 38 saves. If you're looking to pay for a closer, Osuna is one of the safest and most reliable options."
Shohei Ohtani,"DH, SP",Angels,75.0,2.0,84.0,21.0,110.0,4.0,25.0,7.0,1.82,0.98,13.07,24.0,0.0,25.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,2.52,1.0,12.96,"Ohtani will be nearly 22 months removed from Tommy John surgery at the time of 2020 Opening Day, so there's a good chance we'll see him on the mound a significant amount this season. He has already flashed elite ability on both sides of the ball, going 5-for-9 in quality starts with a 3.10 ERA and 30.5% strikeout rate before injuries began to surface in 2018, and hitting .287/.357/.596 with 15 home runs in 59 games as a near-regular designated hitter during the second half of 2019. In leagues with daily lineup locks, the ability to maximize his contributions as either hitter or pitcher, depending upon his daily role, boosts his value ahead of weekly leagues, where he'll be locked into one role or another for the entire scoring period. He's capable of a top-100 contribution overall in any format, even if he's limited to only one role or the other, but the case can be made he's a top-50 talent in our game thanks to the daily format."
Liam Hendriks,RP,Athletics,62.0,0.0,63.0,16.0,122.0,5.0,33.0,0.0,3.71,1.06,11.43,21.0,0.0,22.0,3.0,36.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.27,0.91,12.68,"An increase of more than 2 mph in his average four-seam velocity, and a greater reliance upon it, fueled a massive breakthrough for Hendriks, which culminated with a top-four finish among relief pitchers on both the Player Rater and in terms of total fantasy points. In fact, from the date of his first save on June 22, he had league-leading totals among relievers with 25 saves, 74 strikeouts and an 18.5 K-to-walk ratio. Hendriks' swift turnaround has resulted in his entering 2020 as one of the top picks at his position in any fantasy league, considering his added strikeout potential and locked-in closer role. Draft him among the top eight at his position at minimum, with a chance that he could contend for the top spot over the full campaign."
Kenley Jansen,RP,Dodgers,23.0,12.0,80.0,16.0,80.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,5.29,1.35,10.8,11.0,11.0,62.0,15.0,31.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.77,1.18,10.6,"Jansen's career has significantly swung in the wrong direction the past two seasons, as the average velocity of his cutter dropped in each campaign (culminating in a career-low 91.7 mph in 2019), his strikeout rate fell by more than 10%, and he blew a whopping eight save chances last season. Despite this, he managed to maintain the job all season, finishing 11th among relief pitchers on the Player Rater and 10th in terms of fantasy points. Jansen's 2019 looked as bad as it did partly in contrast to his historic 2015-17 campaigns, but he's still capable of being one of the better choices at his position, even with diminished skills. He should still strike out 30% of the hitters he faces, and his 3.21 SIERA shows that he might be due better fortune in the ERA department this time around. As Blake Treinen, who had a similarly bad 2019, is his primary competition for saves, Jansen should hold his closer job and be at least a top-eight performer at the position."
Carlos Carrasco,"SP, RP",Indians,60.0,0.0,69.0,11.0,96.0,2.0,30.0,10.0,2.61,1.0,11.74,21.0,0.0,21.0,4.0,73.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,9.43,"A leukemia diagnosis sidelined Carrasco for more than 12 weeks last season. While it was heartwarming to see him return to the mound in September, it was as a reliever, making it difficult to glean any fantasy takeaways heading into 2020. He's expected to be at full strength for spring training, and considering he had 28.7% strikeout and 4.0% walk rates in 12 starts before the absence, there's reason to believe he can rebound to his prior form as a top-25 fantasy starter. This is true even as his fantasy stats were destroyed by a .357 BABIP, a 17.9% HR/FB rate and a 73.8 LOB% during that span. Monitor Carrasco's status throughout spring training, as a strong performance would go a long way toward strengthening his case for the upcoming season."
Taylor Rogers,RP,Twins,66.0,0.0,58.0,22.0,90.0,2.0,26.0,1.0,5.59,1.38,15.36,24.0,0.0,23.0,7.0,22.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,3.91,1.04,14.87,"Often, a closer-by-committee remains as such until someone stakes a claim on the primary role. That's what happened with Rogers last season. With a 1.04 ERA after eight games, including four holds and the Opening Day save, the southpaw latched onto closing duties. However, as 69 innings in 60 appearances demonstrates, Rogers often worked multiple frames, taking advantage of his ability to handle batters from either side of the plate. Rogers throws three pitches: a two-seam fastball against all hitters, a slider he uses more against righties, and a curve he mixes in against lefties but rarely throws against right-handers. The slider is his ""out pitch"" facing right-handed bats, while the curve and slider keep lefties at bay. Taylor is again ticketed to be the main closer, likely to continue coming in for multiple stanzas when the situation warrants."
Edwin Diaz,RP,Mets,32.0,32.0,200.1,51.0,99.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.68,1.22,8.76,12.0,12.0,73.0,20.0,38.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.82,1.19,8.75,"Say hello to your 2020 poster boy for ?don't pay for saves,? though the pendulum has a good chance of swinging so far in the opposite direction that Diaz might be a relative bargain at the draft table. His 39.0% strikeout and 8.7% walk rates were right in line with his 38.8%/8.3% combined numbers from his first three big league seasons, as much of his 2019 trouble was caused by the homer-happy baseball as well as the absurd .413 BABIP generated against him by right-handed hitters. Diaz's numbers should rebound closer to his 2016-18 levels, and the Mets remain committed to him as their closer after not moving him during the offseason. If he slips deep outside the top 10 at his position, scoop him up and reap the rewards of all that potential profit."
Jose Berrios,SP,Twins,34.0,34.0,213.0,82.0,195.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.52,1.25,10.69,12.0,12.0,74.0,30.0,71.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.38,1.32,10.34,"On the surface, it looks like Berrios faded after the break for the second season in a row. However, his peripherals and expected ERAs suggest otherwise. Berrios fanned more hitters in the second half, but he allowed more runners on base due to inflated BABIP and walk rates, perhaps from working from the stretch more often following the ""lucky"" hits. Berrios' first-half ERA was 3.00, compared to 4.64 in the second half. However, his FIP hardly budged from the first half to the second half (from 3.85 to 3.86). Meanwhile, his xFIP was actually better after the break, 4.39 compared to 4.22. Berrios doesn't fan enough hitters to be an ace, but he's durable, so he'll get volume from a lofty innings total. He should continue to improve as he matures, just not into elite territory."
Trevor Bauer,SP,Reds,31.0,31.0,175.1,68.0,253.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.87,1.08,10.52,11.0,11.0,60.0,26.0,85.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.9,1.27,9.75,"What was that?! Hailed as one of the best picks at his position in fantasy entering 2019, Bauer's control escaped him. He had a 9.4% walk rate during the Indians' first 81 games, easily his worst in any of his six full seasons with the club. Cleveland finally tired of him and dealt him to Cincinnati in July, where he promptly went just 4-for-10 in quality starts with 12 HRs allowed and a 6.39 ERA. While bad luck had something to do with it -- he had a .321 BABIP and a 17.9% HR/FB rate with the Reds -- the meltdown has now scared off a good number of prospective fantasy managers. Bauer's stuff still generates plenty of swing-and-misses and he has lost only a hint of velocity, so it's worth a shot that with the winter's worth of adjustments, he'll be able to straighten himself out and recapture top-25 starter status. However, it's still anybody's guess if that will actually come to pass."
Sonny Gray,SP,Reds,29.0,29.0,150.2,55.0,205.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.82,1.28,11.11,10.0,10.0,53.0,16.0,65.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.91,1.17,11.04,"While the narrative is that Gray was able to resurrect his career after leaving the Bronx, the more likely impetus for his post-Yankees success was a reunion with Derek Johnson, the Reds' pitching coach and Gray's college mentor. The two worked on Gray's mechanics, leading to increased spin on his four-seamer, slider and curve. Gray's K% went up 7 percentage points but his swinging-strike mark barely improved, suggesting more called strikes. Crisper stuff with a varied pitch mix could fool hitters, but it's unclear how repeatable those results will be. Gray's solid ratio baseline is safe, but how much of his K% gain he maintains is unclear. That said, in addition to Johnson, the Reds hired Driveline Baseball founder Kyle Boddy as a consultant. Boddy will work mostly with the younger arms, but his presence increases the likelihood that Gray maintains his newfound strikeout prowess."
James Paxton,SP,Yankees,7.0,7.0,35.2,15.0,186.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.8,1.65,9.59,10.0,10.0,57.0,12.0,65.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.47,1.11,9.95,"Paxton got off to a hot start with the Yankees, winning three of his first seven starts with a 3.11 ERA with a 25 K-BB%. He then got hurt, reintroducing the concerns about his inability to stay healthy, which plagued him in Seattle. He returned in three weeks, and perhaps returned too quickly, as he had a 5.88 ERA and 1.73 WHIP over his first 11 starts back, but then he won 10 of his final 11 outings with a 2.51 ERA and 0.96 WHIP. The three stanzas of Paxton's 2019 season showed us what he has been before, what he is when things are going poorly and also what he is capable of when everything goes well. All of this said, Paxton has yet to qualify for the ERA title in any one season, as he has missed time each campaign due to injury, and it's only logical to bake an IL stint or two into his 2020 projection."
Corey Kluber,SP,Rangers,6.0,0.0,12.0,3.0,38.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,0.67,12.0,8.0,8.0,44.0,13.0,63.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.48,1.16,9.2,"Nothing seemed to go right for Kluber in 2019. His control left him in his seven April/May starts and then he suffered a non-displaced fracture of his right ulna as a result of being struck by a line drive in his May 1 start. After all that, he suffered a season-ending left oblique strain in an Aug. 18 rehab start for Triple-A Columbus that might have been his final one before activation. He was subsequently traded to the Rangers, who despite their new digs are likely to play in a hitting-friendly environment, further clouding Kluber's bounce-back prospects. He's a pitcher who has begun his decline phase, but it might not be severe just yet, considering his breaking pitches still performed well before he got hurt and his fastball velocity hadn't completely fallen off the table. Draft him as a top-40 fantasy starter, since his ceiling is probably no longer that of an ace/top-10 type."
Jesus Luzardo,RP,Athletics,53.0,0.0,53.0,17.0,16.0,2.0,23.0,0.0,1.87,1.0,14.09,22.0,0.0,21.0,4.0,45.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,2.57,0.9,14.14,"Luzardo was trending towards an Opening Day rotation spot with the Athletics entering 2019, before a shoulder strain cost him two and a half months, then a lat strain suffered during his rehab stint for Triple-A Las Vegas in July shelved him for an additional month. He finally debuted for the big-league club in September as a reliever, and despite the small sample he flashed a four-seam fastball, sinker, slider and changeup that were all plus pitches. Luzardo should enter the spring a favorite for a rotation spot, and with it he'll probably be a popular pick for Rookie of the Year honors. He hasn't exceeded 109 1/3 innings in a single year as a pro, but with the short season he might not be capped at all, giving him bona fide top-30 fantasy starter potential."
Ken Giles,RP,Blue Jays,16.0,16.0,96.0,23.0,83.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.63,1.11,9.66,10.0,10.0,58.0,17.0,33.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.41,1.17,9.16,"It was clear in 2018 that Giles needed a change of scenery after the Astros lost confidence in him. Giles showed signs of turning it around late in the season with Toronto, but his 2019 season was still very surprising. He essentially picked up where he left off in 2016, when he proved to Houston he was ready to close. His 32 K-BB% and 19% swinging-strike rate are elite closer metrics. The expected stats back up what we see in the actual production line from last year. The fastball still isn't a great pitch; the slider is his moneymaker and he will throw it at any point in the count. Giles has the closer mentality and proved he can bounce back from the scrap heap. You can get elite production from Giles, at least for a stretch. The threat of another trade looms."
Frankie Montas,SP,Athletics,60.0,0.0,57.1,18.0,103.0,6.0,34.0,0.0,3.3,1.24,13.19,23.0,0.0,23.0,6.0,59.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.13,1.09,11.35,"Feelings surrounding Montas might be strongly divided entering 2020. In 2019, he broke through with the most impactful campaign of his 10-year professional career -- and by far his best so far in the majors. However, he also served an 80-game PED suspension that might cast some doubt as to its legitimacy. He returned for a single, yet effective, September start, but the positive takeaways should tie to the splitter he added in 2019. The pitch boosted his strikeout and ground ball rates, as well as helped the return of the elite control he occasionally flashed in the minors. Since Montas' breakthrough was a skills-adjustment creation, we lean more toward him continuing said growth this year, but the lengthy absence does make monitoring his spring progress important. Consider him as a top-40 starter candidate with the potential for more. Just understand that volume and consistency are no guarantees."
Brad Hand,RP,Indians,33.0,33.0,208.1,59.0,84.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.67,1.22,10.63,12.0,12.0,72.0,25.0,29.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.75,1.24,9.88,"After three dominant seasons in which Hand split time between setup duty and closing, he was given the ninth-inning reins on Opening Day. Things were proceeding swimmingly, as Hand was sporting a sparkling 2.28 ERA and 1.04 WHIP with 29 saves in 31 chances through Aug. 8, whiffing 73 in 47 1/3 innings. Whether it was from a heavy workload or an undisclosed injury, Hand's effectiveness waned down the stretch, as he worked only 10 more frames, pitching to a bloated 8.10 ERA and 2.20 WHIP, blowing three saves in eight tries. Hand tossed only 2 1/3 innings in September, though an MRI in mid-September suggested nothing more than a tired arm. Hand should break camp with the closer job in a bullpen reinforced with James Karinchak and Emmanuel Clase. The duo should help lighten the load, but they are also a threat to usurp the closer role from him."
Lance Lynn,SP,Rangers,68.0,0.0,65.0,18.0,246.0,5.0,1.0,16.0,3.32,1.08,15.23,23.0,0.0,22.0,5.0,79.0,1.0,13.0,1.0,3.27,1.0,13.5,"Many might be asking, ""Where did that come from?"" Lynn's 28.1% strikeout and 4.17 K/BB rates in 2019 easily set new professional single-year bests (minimum 150 batters faced), but there were obvious causes behind it -- ones that bode well for a potential repeat. He shifted some of his previous reliance upon his sinker into more four-seam fastballs, and his 94.8 mph average with the pitch was the highest in his big league career. With it, his fly ball rate rose to nearly 40% (a big-league-career high) and his swinging-strike rate soared. Lynn is a great example of the need to forget the past while relying on the more recent results. The 2020 edition of Lynn is a top-40 fantasy SP candidate."
Nick Anderson,RP,Rays,33.0,30.0,165.2,47.0,110.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,4.18,1.34,9.4,12.0,12.0,64.0,22.0,33.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.36,1.34,9.14,No outlook available.

By year's end, Fried had posted -- by far -- the lowest walk rate of his professional career (6.7%), and he only seemed to improve as the year progressed, with a 3.63 ERA and a 4.22 K-BB rate after the All-Star break. He'll enter 2020 as a fixed member of the Braves' rotation and, while his struggles minimizing hard contact could make him somewhat inconsistent and matchups-susceptible, Fried should at least be a top-40 fantasy starter in all formats."
Raisel Iglesias,RP,Reds,68.0,0.0,67.2,24.0,89.0,3.0,28.0,2.0,2.93,1.02,11.84,23.0,0.0,22.0,8.0,29.0,1.0,11.0,1.0,3.68,1.14,13.5,"Depending on your estimator of choice, in 2019, Iglesias was the same (if not a better) pitcher compared to 2018, despite his ERA soaring from 2.38 to 4.16. Skillwise, Iglesias fanned more batters while walking fewer last season and allowing a similar number of homers. The main differences were a .233 BABIP in 2018 compared to .316 last year and a 91.6 LOB% in 2019, dropping to 78.9% in 2019. These both incorporate a luck element, hence the substantial variance in ERA. Even with the bloated ERA, Iglesias logged a career-best 36 saves. Iglesias isn't usually mentioned in conversations about dominant relievers. Maybe he deserves to be, after a 15.3% swinging-strike mark over the past two seasons, buoying a career-high 31.9 K% last season. Iglesias is again ticketed for primarily ninth-inning duties, where he has a good chance to at least match last season's saves total."
Hector Neris,RP,Phillies,29.0,29.0,174.2,41.0,89.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.68,1.11,7.32,12.0,12.0,71.0,18.0,33.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.68,1.23,6.97,"After yielding 11 homers in 47.2 innings in 2018, Neris allowed one fewer long ball in 20 more frames, fueling a bounce-back campaign. Oddly, Neris' strikeout and walk rates were worse than in the previous season, but with homers driving run scoring across the league, Neris' ability to keep the ball in the yard landed him the Phillies' closer gig as David Robertson and Seranthony Dominguez succumbed to injuries. After going 28-for-34 in save opportunities, Neris should get first dibs on the 2020 role as new manager Joe Girardi takes over for Gabe Kapler. Neris features a 95 mph fastball and an 87 mph splitter he throws twice as much as the heater. Last season, the BABIP on Neris' splitter was a tidy .220, while the pitch generated a 22% swinging-strike rate. If he can come close to repeating that, Neris could post his first 30-save season."
Mike Soroka,SP,Braves,73.0,0.0,71.2,45.0,142.0,10.0,16.0,15.0,1.88,1.03,13.06,24.0,0.0,24.0,11.0,55.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,1.17,10.13,"Soroka's excellent 2.68 ERA in 29 starts last season earned him second place in NL Rookie of the Year voting. It's wise to expect a fair amount of regression from that number, which ranked fifth among qualified starters, but just how much is unclear. ERA estimators such as FIP (3.45), xFIP (3.85) and SIERA (4.28) differ widely. He will need to keep his ERA low again this season if he's to be a fantasy star, as his below-average 20.3 K% doesn't turn any heads. It's unlikely that his 92.5 mph fastball will suddenly lead to a significantly higher strikeout rate, but Soroka's impressive control (5.9 BB%) and contact management (51.2% groundball rate) bode well for continued success. Many are running away from Soroka, but the youngster has already shown that he can be a quality arm, even without elite whiffs."
Brandon Workman,RP,Red Sox,14.0,14.0,73.0,30.0,104.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.07,1.26,12.95,11.0,11.0,59.0,25.0,27.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.42,1.31,10.53,"Lost in the disappointing 2019 Red Sox campaign was the surfacing of a quality closer, as Workman emerged from a committee to log 16 post-break saves. The right-hander also notched 15 holds, eclipsing the century mark with 104 strikeouts in 71.2 innings. But Workman's season comes with a couple of warnings. He's older than some might realize, turning 31 last August. More important, Workman's 1.88 ERA was a mirage, as suggested by the associated 3.33 xFIP and 3.78 SIERA. Further, an inflated 15.7% walk rate was masked by a lucky .209 BABIP. However, if Workman can come anywhere near his 36.4 K% from last season, the regression blow should be soft. Despite the late-season success, Workman isn't assured of breaking camp as the closer, but he has to be considered the favorite."
Dinelson Lamet,SP,Padres,66.0,1.0,71.2,36.0,105.0,4.0,18.0,7.0,3.52,1.44,10.93,21.0,0.0,22.0,7.0,69.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,4.09,1.27,8.59,"Few pitchers could have enjoyed as smooth a recovery from Tommy John surgery as Lamet did in 2019. He returned to professional action just over 13 months from the date of the operation, rejoining his big league club after just 15 months and posted a professional-best 33.6% strikeout rate in 14 Padres starts. In the process, he saw an uptick in average fastball velocity, sported a passable sinker, and had a slider as good as (and arguably better than) he had pre-surgery. He also narrowed his platoon splits to 21 points' worth of wOBA, another ingredient in his 2020 breakthrough-candidate recipe. If he soars well within the top 40 starting pitchers on draft boards, though, pump the brakes because of two things: (1) his slight fly ball leaning and (2) the possibility that his workload will be closely monitored after he totaled 97 frames in 2019."
Archie Bradley,RP,Diamondbacks,29.0,29.0,182.2,24.0,87.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.41,1.01,8.03,11.0,11.0,64.0,14.0,21.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.94,1.17,8.44,"Just when many of his 2017-18 gains seemed to escape him, with an ERA of 5.66 and a 12.4% walk rate in Arizona's first 81 games of 2019, Bradley suddenly straightened things out. He posted a 1.47 ERA and a 28.6% K-rate in the latter half of the season, ultimately capturing the team's closer role following Greg Holland's midseason meltdown. The improvement coincided with an increased reliance upon his curveball to pair with his usual mid-90s mph fastball, things that bode well for Bradley's prospects of a repeat. He'll begin 2020 as the Diamondbacks' clear closer, with superior skills to the names setting him up. Bradley's control isn't on par with some of the elite at his position, which is the lone hurdle to his becoming a locked-in, top-10 fantasy closer. However, he's also not far from it."
Hyun-Jin Ryu,SP,Blue Jays,,,,,163.0,,,,,,,,,,,60.0,,,,,,,"Ryu made an unlikely Cy Young push last season, carrying an ERA below 2.00 late into the season. A late slump brought that figure up to a still-excellent 2.32 and saw him finish second in the voting behind Jacob deGrom. Ryu's 22.5 K% was slightly below average, but his miniscule 3.3 BB% was second among qualified starters. Ryu's 3.10 FIP was strong but trailed his ERA by a significant amount. It's possible that he's the rare pitcher who reliably outperforms his peripherals. In fact, his ERA beat his FIP by an even greater margin in both 2017 and 2018. That adds to the risk already inherent in any pitcher heading into his age-33 season. He's also hurt by his move to Toronto, where wins will be harder to come by. Altogether, he's less interesting than a typical Cy Young runner-up, but is still a quality arm."
Jose Leclerc,RP,Rangers,70.0,3.0,68.2,39.0,100.0,2.0,14.0,7.0,4.33,1.33,13.11,23.0,0.0,22.0,12.0,31.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.68,1.23,12.68,"Leclerc entered 2019 as an exciting closer option after posting a 1.56 ERA and a 38.1 K% the season prior. Things didn't go as planned, however, as a poor start saw him lose the ninth-inning role by the end of April. An up-and-down season didn't end terribly, though, as he regained the closing job in the second half and finished with 14 saves, a respectable -- given his home park -- 4.33 ERA and a 33.4 K%. Leclerc again enters the year as an interesting lower-tier closing option, especially given the lack of obvious alternatives in the Rangers' bullpen, but the added year of shaky performance makes him a bigger risk than he was previously. If things go wrong again this season, command is likely to be a culprit, as Leclerc recorded a 13.0 BB% last season and has a 14.9 BB% over his career."
Madison Bumgarner,SP,Diamondbacks,34.0,34.0,207.2,43.0,203.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.9,1.13,8.8,12.0,12.0,73.0,19.0,63.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.56,1.26,7.77,"Bumgarner cleared the 200-inning plateau after two seasons of falling well short of that mark. His ratios were not where they were in his prime, but considering the baseball and the run environment last year, he pitched effectively. It was good to see his fastball velocity trend back upward after it looked to be fading in 2018. Bumgarner seems older than 30, since he has been in the league since 2009. The move to Arizona leaves him in the division he has called home for his entire career, and the Diamondbacks have the potential to provide him with the type of run support he has not seen since the 2016 season. He should be able to get back to the mid-teens in wins with Arizona while continuing his levels of production in strikeouts and the rate categories."
Kyle Hendricks,SP,Cubs,30.0,30.0,177.0,32.0,150.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.46,1.13,7.63,12.0,12.0,70.0,16.0,56.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.99,1.23,7.2,"Hendricks is a fascinating pitcher to watch, given what he is not. The spin rate on his fastball ranks in the bottom fifth percentile and he has the worst fastball velocity of all qualified starting pitchers. Yet he does a phenomenal job of limiting hard contact and has an above-average strikeout rate for a starting pitcher. He uses an old-school approach of pounding all levels of the strike zone while keeping hitters off balance by changing eye level as often as he changes speeds. He has been able maintain his effectiveness even while the baseball he uses has gone through changes, and he has missed fewer than 10 starts over the past five seasons. There is not a ceiling and a floor with Hendricks; rather, he just has a flat surface of amazing consistency. You know exactly what you're getting with him; nothing more, nothing less."
Eduardo Rodriguez,SP,Red Sox,34.0,34.0,203.1,75.0,213.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,3.76,1.32,9.43,9.0,9.0,52.0,19.0,55.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.98,1.27,9.52,"Two things spawned a Rodriguez breakthrough in 2019. First, a rise in his ground ball rate to 49.5% (41.5% for his career), and perhaps most importantly, better health, as he reached the 30-start and 200-IP plateaus for the first time in his 10-year professional career. The latter might be the tougher ingredient to repeat, though when healthy, Rodriguez boasts a solid four-pitch mix (four-seam fastball/cutter/changeup/sinker) and balanced platoon splits (lefties actually have a career wOBA 31 points higher against him than righties). This makes him a ""very good, even if not elite"" starter. His high-water mark for fantasy was last year's top-20 SP finish in both rotisserie and points-based leagues, but it's probably not worth paying for a flat repeat. Assume some regression in playing time and hope to get him as more of a top-30 pick at the position."
Zac Gallen,SP,Diamondbacks,15.0,15.0,80.0,36.0,96.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.81,1.23,10.8,11.0,11.0,58.0,20.0,51.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.19,1.29,7.91,"Gallen had a torrid start to 2019 for Triple-A New Orleans, going 10-for-14 in quality starts with nine wins, a 1.77 ERA and a sparkling 5.1% walk rate. That earned him a midseason promotion from the Marlins, and he continued to show growth -- both for Miami, as well as for the Diamondbacks following his deadline trade there. His average fastball velocity actually increased by more than a full mph for Arizona and his changeup was one of the more effective in the game, helping him generate a good number of swings-and-misses while keeping his platoon splits balanced. If there are areas of growth, he could stand to elevate his ground ball rate up to his roughly 45% minor league career number, as well as to minimize hard contact. Still, there's a lot to like with Gallen, assuming he can emerge from the spring as the No. 5 starter. If so, he might have the upside of a top-30 fantasy SP."
Lance McCullers Jr.,SP,Astros,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,55.0,21.0,62.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.76,1.2,10.15,"By all reports, McCullers will report to spring training coming off his regular offseason program, having recovered fully from November 2018 Tommy John surgery. The Astros will surely keep his workload in check, after he totaled 126 2/3 and 128 1/3 innings in 2017 and 2018, but in the games he gives you he might be one of the most tantalizing strikeout artists you can select outside the top 25 at his position. When healthy, McCullers' curveball is as effective as anyone's in the game, fueling a 26.6% career strikeout rate, and his sinker helps keep his ground ball rate in the high-50% range, raising his statistical floor. He's an important arm to watch during the spring, and in the best-case scenario could warrant a selection among the top 40 starters."
Craig Kimbrel,RP,Cubs,23.0,0.0,20.2,12.0,30.0,0.0,13.0,0.0,6.53,1.6,13.06,21.0,0.0,20.0,10.0,30.0,0.0,11.0,0.0,5.4,1.3,13.5,"Kimbrel and his agent played the waiting game, and it ended up impacting Kimbrel's effectiveness in 2019. He did not pitch in his first major league game until June 27 and closed the season with 13 saves in 16 chances along with a career-worst ERA and WHIP. His final average fastball velocity finished the season 2 mph below where it was two seasons ago, and the declining velocity has led to his strikeout rate falling from amazing levels to just-better-than-average levels. His expected stats say his performance was earned rather than unlucky. Simply put, Kimbrel is entering a different phase of his career. Indicators are trending in the wrong direction, and while all growth and failure is not linear, the past two seasons are concerning. Quite honestly, the strikeouts are the only safe thing in his skill set for 2020."
Zack Wheeler,SP,Phillies,31.0,31.0,195.1,50.0,195.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.96,1.26,8.98,10.0,10.0,60.0,18.0,55.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.5,1.27,8.25,"A second straight strong and healthy season saw Wheeler, a former Met, receive a big payday from the division-rival Phillies, who gave him a five-year, $118 million deal in December. While he did see his ERA jump from 3.31 to 3.96, his peripherals remained at a similar level. While his K% slid slightly from 24.1 to 23.6, his BB% improved from 7.4 to 6.0. It's somewhat surprising that the righty's hard fastball, which averaged a career-high 96.7 mph, didn't lead to a more impressive strikeout rate, but don't expect a major jump in that category this year given his below-average 10.4% swinging-strike rate. Heading into his age-30 season, Wheeler projects to be more good than great, especially given his tougher new home park. That's still enough to make him an interesting option once the top starters are off the board."
Julio Urias,"RP, SP",Dodgers,37.0,8.0,79.2,27.0,85.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,2.49,1.08,9.6,10.0,10.0,51.0,21.0,54.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.06,1.27,9.53,"Urias has recovered brilliantly from the shoulder issues that plagued him in 2017-18, and pitched admirably in a multitude of different roles in his comeback year in 2019. His fastball velocity recovered, reaching 95.2 mph on average, and he saw his strikeout rate swell to 26.9% after the All-Star break, things that bode well for another step forward in 2020. Urias has a greater chance at an expanded role after an offseason that saw the Dodgers lose a couple of starting pitchers to trades or free agency, and he was once considered an ace-in-the-making. It'd be asking a lot for this arm with no more than 122 innings on it in seven professional seasons to handle a full-time starter's role, but so long as tight workload management doesn't bother you, he's an appealing sleeper."
Alex Colome,RP,White Sox,62.0,0.0,61.0,23.0,55.0,4.0,30.0,0.0,2.8,1.07,8.11,23.0,0.0,23.0,8.0,25.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,3.52,1.17,9.78,"Colome's 91% save success rate (30-for-33) was second behind Kirby Yates among all relievers with at least 30 saves last season. The incumbent closer should return to ninth-inning duties for the improved White Sox. That said, the 31-year-old right-hander will be hard-pressed to repeat last season's performance, as a lucky .215 BABIP bailed out a dropping K rate and growing walk rate. To be fair, Colome's 13% swinging-strike rate portends to a K-rate north of the 22% mark that he posted last season, but spotty control limited his punchouts. The White Sox added Steve Cishek to fortify the bullpen, though Aaron Bummer might be the better handcuff in the event that Colome's hit-rate regression torpedoes his ERA. He had a 2.80 ERA last season but with a more-telling 4.61 xFIP. Team context has definitely improved, but beware, Colome isn't as safe as last season's ratios might suggest."

What if Boyd were traded to a better team? What if Boyd were able to fix his home run problem? The former seems like a strong bet to happen, but the latter does not. Even in 2018, Boyd had a well-above-average HR/9 (1.43) as a heavy fly ball pitcher. Last season, Boyd ranked among the elite in terms of swing-and-miss dominance and limiting walks, finishing eighth among qualified starters with a 23.9 K/BB%, ahead of Jack Flaherty, Stephen Strasburg and Charlie Morton, to name a few. However, the homers only crept up in the second half, saddling him with a 5.51 ERA and 1.38 WHIP after the All-Star break. Getting out of Detroit would help Boyd's value -- he has never cracked double-digit wins -- but at this point a dramatic ascent is unlikely."
Robbie Ray,SP,Diamondbacks,34.0,33.0,174.1,84.0,235.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.34,1.34,12.13,11.0,11.0,58.0,29.0,71.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.66,1.38,11.02,"Ray decided to stop trying to make his changeup happen because it was never going to happen. He instead has turned to throwing two different breaking balls and two different fastballs to help keep righties off balance. The approach worked better in 2017 and 2018, and while he struck out 32% of the righties he faced, he also allowed 26 homers to righties and had a 1.45 WHIP against them. On the whole, Ray continues to pile up strikeouts, as his strikeout rate has been above 30% in each of the past three seasons, but his walk rate has been in double digits the past three seasons. The walks and the issues with righties inflate his WHIP to unacceptable levels. This is his final year before free agency, and his overall value is trending in the wrong direction."
Will Smith,RP,Braves,63.0,0.0,65.1,21.0,96.0,6.0,34.0,0.0,2.76,1.03,13.22,15.0,0.0,15.0,4.0,20.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,12.0,"Outside of a second-half-of-2019 blip that might've been influenced by back issues, Smith has been an outstanding late-inning reliever in back-to-back seasons, which earned him a big free-agent contract with the Braves during the offseason. While the team announced Mark Melancon as its Opening Day closer shortly thereafter, Smith's skills paint the picture of a superior ninth-inning option, so a switch might be in the cards early in the campaign. From 2018-19 and among relievers with at least 100 innings, Smith's 2.66 ERA ranked 17th, 1.01 WHIP ranked 10th, 48 saves ranked 15th and 167 strikeouts ranked 13th. He also limited right-handed hitters to .210/.292/.364 rates, his lack of a severe platoon split making him a safer investment, considering his uncertain role. Smith might not be worth drafting as a top-10 closer initially due to that, but he has the ability and can contribute to your ERA, WHIP and strikeouts in the meantime."
Kenta Maeda,"SP, RP",Twins,37.0,26.0,153.2,51.0,169.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,4.04,1.07,9.9,14.0,10.0,58.0,19.0,66.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.19,1.16,10.24,"Maeda's desire to pitch on the West Coast led to him signing a team-friendly deal with the Dodgers years ago. The Dodgers thanked him by moving him to the bullpen pretty much every season, keeping him at an arm's length from incentives in his contract. Now, to be fair, there were concerns about Maeda's elbow when he signed and the workload management may have been beneficial to his overall numbers (just not his wallet). It's no lock that the Twins will ask Maeda to make 30 starts after acquiring him in a February trade, but their starting pitching depth is limited and he may end up being their ace. There's little doubt they will start him, even if they have to skip a start here or there. The right-hander's K-BB rate has ranged from 18.9% to 20.7% over the last three seasons -- not quite elite marks, but very good. Maeda keeps hitters off balance with a four-pitch mix and, following the trade, should go a lot higher than his current ADP."
Hansel Robles,RP,Angels,71.0,1.0,72.2,16.0,75.0,5.0,23.0,2.0,2.48,1.02,9.29,21.0,0.0,23.0,6.0,24.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,3.13,1.09,9.39,"Robles might not have the name recognition of other top-tier closers, but his results say he belongs in the group. He held opponents to a .217 batting average and had a 20.8% K-BB, with solid ratios and 23 saves for his efforts. He did not have the job to open the season but took it by force in late April and never relinquished it. He has 95th-percentile velocity on his fastball, which he complements with a devastating split-change and average slider. The changeup was the game changer for him as the pitch was barely in his tool kit the previous two seasons, but the pitch generated a 20% swinging-strike rate in 2019, well above any previous efforts. His spike in velocity has made the changeup look even better, and he should be pushed up your draft boards accordingly."
Sean Manaea,SP,Athletics,5.0,5.0,29.2,7.0,30.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.21,0.78,9.1,10.0,10.0,58.0,14.0,54.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.72,1.12,8.38,"Shoulder surgery that cut Manaea's 2018 short by a month limited him to only a month's regular season big-league time in 2019, but during that brief time he pitched about as effectively as he has at any time during his professional career. While it's obvious that his 1.21 ERA in those five starts is unsustainable over a full year -- heed his 3.42 FIP, which in itself was a career best -- his boosted strikeout rate, fueled mostly by a rise in slider usage, suggests that he might continue on the level of a top-40 fantasy starter for so long as he's healthy. Manaea's pro high-water mark of 162 2/3 innings (2017) casts some volume concerns, but he has enough potential to warrant a selection nearly within that tier."

Puk,RP,Athletics,10.0,0.0,11.1,5.0,13.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,3.18,1.32,10.32,13.0,9.0,51.0,20.0,63.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3.88,1.25,11.12,"Puk, who had Tommy John surgery in April 2018, returned to professional action within 14 months, and while the Athletics were mindful of his workload in his first half-season back, they were encouraged enough by the results to grant him a cup of coffee in relief with the big club in the season's final six weeks. While he'll have to dial down his velocity slightly if used as expected as a starter in 2020, his 97.1 mph average four-seam fastball and slider combo proved a lethal combo, with the improvement of his changeup key to his breakthrough prospects. Puk warrants close attention in his race to make the roster, with said changeup as well as his control (5 walks in 11 1/3 big-league frames) the things to track most, but even if he begins the year in the minors he'll be a worthy stash, an instant add upon his promotion date and a top dynasty pick."
German Marquez,SP,Rockies,29.0,28.0,174.0,35.0,175.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.76,1.2,9.05,12.0,12.0,71.0,18.0,72.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.07,1.31,9.13,"Marquez had one of the greatest seasons in Rockies history in 2018. His 230 strikeouts set a franchise record and his 3.40 FIP trailed only Ubaldo Jimenez's 2009-10 numbers. However, the follow-up began swiftly and fell apart quickly. Through two months, he had a 3.48 ERA, a 1.14 WHIP and a 23.7% strikeout rate in 13 starts. Then, a rise in his fly ball rate led to his serving up 20 home runs over his next 15 appearances, unraveling his season. Arm fatigue ultimately cut his year short. Marquez calls unforgiving Coors Field his home, which all but assures that such bad luck can strike him again. The abrupt end to his 2019 raises durability concerns that hadn't previously been present. He remains capable of 200 K's if healthy, which on its own might be enough to guarantee a top-40 starter valuation. Still, as a Colorado pitcher, it's best to pick and choose from his matchups."
Carlos Martinez,RP,Cardinals,48.0,0.0,48.1,18.0,53.0,4.0,24.0,3.0,3.17,1.18,9.87,10.0,10.0,58.0,22.0,58.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.88,1.28,9.0,"Was 2019 a harbinger of Martinez's future or just a bridge season before he returns to the Cardinals' rotation? St. Louis will give Martinez the opportunity to show he can start in spring training, though it should be noted the Cardinals did more to bolster their rotation than bullpen during the offseason, facilitating a permanent move to relief. Martinez thrived in late-inning duty last season, logging 24 saves and three holds, with 21 saves and a pair of holds coming after the All-Star break. The transition to relief was due to a late start to the season, as a strain in his right rotator cuff kept him out until mid-May. Martinez underwent a procedure on his shoulder in October and is expected to be healthy. Based on his injury history, it seems like Martinez would be safer and more valuable as a closer."
Mike Minor,SP,Rangers,32.0,32.0,208.1,68.0,200.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.59,1.24,8.64,12.0,12.0,75.0,23.0,74.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.72,1.17,8.88,"Minor finished 2019 the No. 85 overall name on the Player Rater and 56th in terms of fantasy points, but as a pitcher with a beneath-25% strikeout and above-40% fly ball rate, he's one with which to be cautious. Some pertinent stats: He had a 4.18 ERA and 4.43 FIP in 28 starts in 2018, and 4.99/4.84 numbers in those same categories in 15 starts over the Rangers' final 81 team games in 2019. Much of his success was the product of good health and volume, and while those might repeat, he's also a pitcher who calls a hitting-friendly environment his home and had a 4.00 ERA against winning teams. The odds are greater he'll finish outside the top 40 at his position than within it."

Weaver was coming off a disappointing 2018 but took to the desert quite well, sporting a 3.03 ERA and 1.11 WHIP in late May when he was sidelined with forearm tightness. To that point, he punched out 68 batters in 62.1 innings while walking just 14. Weaver deploys a four-pitch arsenal: a four-seam fastball, changeup, cutter and curveball. With Arizona, he used the heater less often and mixed in more curves and cutters, which helped increase his swinging strike rate to a career best 10.4%. His changeup is his strikeout pitch, especially against lefties. Weaver returned in September, and although he threw just two innings that was a good sign for his health. He will compete alongside Merrill Kelly and Mike Leake for the final two rotation spots, but is the most likely of the group to emerge with one. However, Arizona could take advantage of their depth and limit his innings in something of a swing role."

He has a hard fastball with a lot of spin to it and a very effective slider. He has back-to-back seasons of K-BB rates greater than 20% and an improving swinging-strikeout rate. He also has his flaws: Inconsistent command leads to his stuff being more hittable than it should be, a heavy flyball outcome leads to gopheritis, and the team will likely win fewer than 60 games yet again in 2020. Even bad teams need closers, and that role is Jimenez's to lose in 2020. A step forward in command would reduce the ill-placed fastballs that become souvenirs and allow him to work more with his slider ahead in the count. He can't close for a contender, but Detroit is far from that, so it allows him time to improve."

An elbow injury cost him the season's first month, and after his return, a 6.37 ERA in his first 11 starts ultimately led to a demotion back to Triple-A. There, he made a few mechanical adjustments, posted a 2.67 ERA in six starts and earned an August recall, after which point he had a 2.65 ERA in 10 regular-season starts. Foltynewicz's struggles remind us that he's not the most consistent pitcher out there, and his average fastball velocity and his strikeout rate did both drop, casting some doubt on his ability to recapture his 2018 form. He should begin the year in the Braves' rotation but is more of a top-40 option at his position rather than something greater."

He missed time with knee tendonitis, struggled to adapt to the distances the new baseball traveled, was more hittable in the strike zone than ever and had his lowest swinging-strike rate in four seasons. Despite the struggles, he contributed 29 saves and earned a World Series ring. If the new baseball is here to stay, Doolittle will not be long for the closer role, as his heavy flyball rates are going to lead to too many issues in the late innings. His other measures hold up for closing, but no manager can live with gopheritis from his closer for too long. Daniel Hudson and Will Harris are viable alternatives for Washington in the ninth."

Musgrove's 4.44 ERA last season was slightly better than league average, but a low LOB% -- a metric largely out of a pitcher's control -- leads to the conclusion that number can go a lot lower. In 2018, his first with the Pirates, Musgrove's LOB% was 69.2%. It plummeted to 63.2% last season, with both marks coming in well below the 72.3% league average. Musgrove isn't dominant, but a 16.4% K%-BB% with a below-average home run rate should lead to a lower ERA than he typically posts. Musgrove throws six pitches, with his changeup, cut fastball and slider all generating swinging strikes at a 17.6% clip or higher. He uses his cutter and sinker about 20% of the time combined, despite those offerings being less effective. Fine-tuning his repertoire, along with better luck in the ERA department, could help Musgrove finally get to the level many have expected him to reach."

Checking under the hood, Tanaka's velocity has been in gentle decline, but not enough to account for last season's ERA spike. The culprit was an 11.6% swinging-strike mark with his splitter, half of what he was able to entice the prior two campaigns. Tanaka needs the splitter to be effective as his fastball generates swinging strikes at a meager 7% clip, while his slider has checked in around 15% over the past two years. The spin rate on Tanaka's splitter was higher than usual, something detrimental to pitches designed to drop. If he can correct that, Tanaka can again be a solid fantasy asset. It's not a sure thing, however, rendering the 31-year-old right-hander a risk."

He flashed a career high in average four-seam fastball velocity (96.1 mph), but finished with his lowest strikeout rate (23.6%) since 2015. He kept the ball down, with a career-best 50% ground ball rate, yet allowed a career-worst and one of the league's worst hard-contact rates (44%). The sum of the parts made Gray a top-70 fantasy starter -- and that's in spite of his season ending prematurely due to a fractured foot -- but extracting peak value from his individual starts has proven awfully difficult. Such is the nature of Rockies pitchers, and there aren't hints Gray is due for significantly more."

The South Side is a sneaky-good landing spot for Keuchel. Not only did the White Sox also sign Yasmani Grandal, one of the best framers in the game, but Guaranteed Rate Field is a stealth pitching venue -- especially for hurlers adept at keeping the ball in the yard. Even in his salad days, Keuchel wasn't dominant, relying on control and his defense. That's why last season's elevated walk rate is a concern, although it was likely the result of a late start to the campaign. Keuchel's low strikeout rate hurts his fantasy potential, but a beneficial team context in a weak division should provide ample opportunity to deploy Keuchel in favorable matchups. He's ideally suited for daily leagues."

Those aren't eye-popping numbers, but they fell very much into the ""matchups-capable starter"" bin, and that the White Sox landed him a pitch-framing artist in Yasmani Grandal behind the plate might only boost those 2020 prospects. Lopez isn't quite there as a top breakthrough candidate, but he's also not the pitcher either his full-2019 or career stats indicate. He's worth the dart throw for one of your final mixed-league pitching spots."

He rode the Triple-A shuttle the rest of the way while filling in as their schedule-dependent fifth starter, but in the majors his strengths were his 4.2% walk rate and .224 wOBA against left-handed hitters -- his .344 against righties, however, was a concern -- rather than his missing bats. Those traits are enough to make him a strong bet for a rotation spot come Opening Day, as well as a deep-mixed or AL-only flier, but he's probably not the whiff artist he showed in the minors last year."

His ERA swelled to 5.36 and walk rate to 10.4% in his 16 post-IL-stint starts, though it's important to point out that he also finished the campaign with a pro-best 153 1/3 innings and might've been somewhat fatigued late. Perhaps Smith will be better equipped to maintain a top-40-capable fantasy starter performance deeper into 2020 this time around, but he does have a history of high walk and fly-ball rates that threaten his start-over-start consistency. Mind his matchups."

James, unfortunately, offers little else, his walk rate a ghastly 13.2% and fly-ball rate 46.5%, making him a three-true-outcomes type on the pitching side (rarely a good thing on that end). It's possible the Astros will restore him to the rotation competition during the spring, but even if he's ticketed for relief again, he'll need to show more control to be more than an AL-only late-rounder."

His ERA jumped to 3.77 with New York, but his 3.84 xFIP was an improvement over the 4.06 mark he notched with the Blue Jays. Stroman's strikeout rate improved considerably with the Mets -- from 19.3% to 23.0% -- though that coincided with a two-percentage-point jump in his walk rate. In addition, the right-hander's groundball rate (48.3%) plummeted while his HR/9 (1.21) skyrocketed with New York. That's uncharacteristic for Stroman, long one of baseball's most groundball-extreme hurlers. Expect a regression to the mean in 2020, opening the door for some viability as a back-end fantasy starter, especially if Stroman can continue kicking up his strikeout numbers."

He worked only 58.2 innings, the lowest total since he rejuvenated his career in 2015. Hill averaged 23 starts and 126.2 innings from 2016-18, but a sprained left MCL delayed his 2019 debut until late April. Hill pitched effectively until mid-June, when he was shelved with left forearm tightness. He made it back in September but battled an MCL while making abbreviated appearances. Hill underwent elbow surgery in October, with a 2020 midseason return expected. The Twins signed the southpaw to an incentive-laden contract, looking for second-half help in anticipation of another playoff run. Hill's 29.3 K% last season suggests he can still be dominant as he embarks on his age-40 season. Hill is a worthwhile stash in leagues with deep reserves or separate IL spots."

When doctors went in for surgery, they found Melancon's pronator muscle was turning gray from a lack of oxygen. It took a while, but with the way Melancon pitched in 2019, it seems we can safely say he made a full recovery. At 34 years old, Melancon was a top-12 qualifying reliever by FIP. He ranked fourth in groundball rate with a 62.1% mark, and his strikeout rate was up six percentage points from 2018. He seized the closer job following a deadline trade to the Braves, and it was reported that he will remain the primary closer to begin 2020, even with Will Smith joining him in Atlanta. Many expect Smith to take the job eventually, though."

Unfortunately, that ceiling has lowered considerably, as his average fastball velocity dipped to a career-low 91.2 mph in 2019, he served up 26-plus homers for a third consecutive year and saw his walk rate rise to 8.3%. In Bundy's defense, however, his swinging-strike rate rose for the fourth consecutive season and his 42% ground ball rate was a career high, so perhaps a small step forward is possible following his trade to the Angels. There's enough here to warrant a late-round mixed league or middle-of-your-staff AL-only pick, but be cautious expecting much more."

From April 11 to May 21, he posted a 2.32 ERA in 50.1 innings and complemented that with another stretch in which he struck out 33 batters and allowed only four earned runs over 26.1 frames in August. Yet the southpaw concluded the season with the worst ERA (4.68) of his career, thanks in part to an ugly finish -- 23 earned runs over his last 18.2 innings. It would be convenient to chalk up his struggles to bad luck, but that would be glossing over his career-worst 37.7 Hard% and 29.2 LD%. Quintana also continued a three-year decline in strikeout rate, dropping to a below-average 20.4% last season. He should be viewed as merely a streamer in fantasy leagues."

The Padres signed him to a two-year deal that off-season with the expectation that Richards would be ready for the 2020 campaign. The oft-injured right-hander made it back on the hill late last season, throwing 8 2/3 innings over three appearances, walking six but fanning 11. While his control was obviously off, Richards velocity was only half a tick below his pre-surgery level, boding well for 2020. Barring a setback in the offseason, Richards will slot into the Padres rotation and be a fantasy wild-card. He's shown ace stuff in-between injuries so he's worth a speculative play when drafting a group of pitchers you're planning on streaming."

While some good fortune on balls in play contributed (.207 BABIP), his 5.81 K-to-walk full season ratio coupled with a massive boost in the performance of his slider hammered home his arrival as an elite late-inning reliever. The Cardinals haven't firmed up the identity of their closer -- it could be Carlos Martinez, or Andrew Miller, or Gallegos or a committee -- so Gallegos has as much fantasy upside as anyone not locked into the role, since he's arguably the most deserving of it of the bunch. He'll also be one of the most effective choices in holds leagues even if he doesn't emerge in the ninth."

A closer look under the hood shows he was done in by a 10.64 first-inning ERA, a .478 overall BABIP and a 59.6% overall LOB rate. His FIP, unbelievably, was 3.19 -- a sign that inexplicably bad luck plagued him, and he did have five serviceable starts out of eight to conclude the year. Keller should get better bounces this time around, and he has swing-and-miss stuff that should lock him into the Pirates rotation. He's a wise late-round stash, even in a 12-team mixed league."

He continued to be stingy with the walks and kept hitters off balance, but like many, struggled to keep the new baseball in the yard and was a bit more hittable, resulting in an ERA that was out of balance with a solid WHIP. He does not have great stuff, but the combination of his pitches and how he executed them drove his 2018 success. Last season, the slider -- a pitch he throws 25% of the time -- failed him miserably. Batters hit .184 off Mikolas' slider in 2018, swinging and missing 14% of the time. Last season batters hit .287 off the same pitch while swinging and missing only 11% of the time.

The 24-year-old posted a 2.35 ERA in 13 starts across the two highest levels of the minors last season and carried that performance into his first stint in the big leagues, recording a 2.34 ERA in 10 starts. His 7.1 BB% was strong, but his unimpressive 20.3 K% should cast some doubts on his ability to approach the level of his aforementioned teammates. Civale relied on contact management to prevent runs last season, holding opponents to a miniscule 2.4% barrel rate. It's tough to fully buy into that skill after just 10 starts. Those who buy the hype this offseason are at risk of Civale being little more than a low-whiff back-end starter, though the risk is not that great if he remains among the more speculative part of the draft class."

After his first four appearances, spanning 3.2 frames, Lugo had a bloated 12.77 ERA and 3.00 WHIP. From that point on, he posted a 2.24 ERA and a 0.90 WHIP, fanning 99 in 76.1 innings. The right-hander finished with six saves, 21 holds and seven vultured wins. A converted starter, Lugo continues to deploy the same four-pitch mix he utilized in the rotation but with the expected bump in velocity. With the Mets fortifying their bullpen, Lugo may receive the opportunity to return to the rotation. His success will depend on how much of the velocity gains he can maintain, along how well he takes to being stretched out again, though his workload has been hefty out of the bullpen. If he stays a reliever, Lugo is a top option in holds leagues as well as formats favoring ratio support from dominant relievers."

He did battle some gopheritis, but that was the case for pretty much everyone in 2019, and Chirinos still finished with roughly $5 earned in 12-team mixed leagues. Right middle finger inflammation limited Chirinos to just 33.1 innings after the All-Star break after he threw 100 frames in the first half, and his performance slipped in those 33.1 innings, hurting his overall season numbers. He was deployed occasionally as a ""primary"" or ""bulk"" reliever -- eight of his 26 appearances came out of the bullpen -- and the Rays have said Chirinos may not be a full-time starter in 2020. Chances are, Chirinos will blow past 100 innings again while pushing close to double-digit wins with strong ratios, but the unconventional usage does put a cap on his fantasy upside."

Even with it, he had some tantalizing ratios that put him on the 2020 sleeper list: 5.8% walk rate, 3.52 K-to-walk ratio, 48% ground ball rate, things that make him one of the higher-ceiling picks among late-rounder candidates. Lopez is one to watch during spring training, as the healthy version has a chance at turning in a top-50 fantasy starter season."

The Rays were attracted to Pagan's fastball spin rate, his ability to work up in the zone and his effectiveness against righties. They believed there was more in his tank and they were right, as they got him to consistently let his high-spin fastball ride up in the zone to great results. Pagan had career-best strikeout and swinging-strike rates and ended up with 20 saves to lead the club. The expected stats validate the solid performance from the former middle reliever as well, but he is not without flaws. Living up in the zone comes with the risk of allowing homers, and Pagan allowed 25 in 132 innings over the past two seasons. It is unlikely that issue will go away."
Josh Lindblom,SP,Brewers,,,,,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,47.0,14.0,40.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.98,1.36,7.66,"Signed during the offseason by the Brewers following back-to-back solid seasons in the Korean Baseball Organization, Lindblom should claim a rotation spot with the team this spring, his first regular such role in the U.S. He had hints of relief success with the Dodgers in 2011-12, but has since become a control artist (4.6% walk rate in 2018-19) with a useful combination of a low-90s fastball, a slider/cutter hybrid and a splitter. At first glance, Lindblom might play to his matchups rather than be an every-start option in fantasy, but he's worth watching during Cactus League play for a better read. View him as a deep-mixed/NL-only late-rounder."

Now back with the Dodgers, he should have the inside track on a rotation spot, but he's a dangerous pitcher to presume healthy enough for even 20 starts. Consider him more of an NL-only late rounder."

While his 2019 wasn't as sparkling as his 2018, it contained similarly appealing peripherals: 3.47 FIP (five-hundredths off his 2018 number), 5.4% walk rate, 50% ground ball rate, 8.5 Runs Above Average with his curveball. #FreeStripling might again be a popular hash tag in 2020, as a committed rotation spot might go a long way towards cementing him a top-50 fantasy starter.

As one might expect after such a long layoff, Pineda improved as the season progressed. His first half ERA and WHIP were 4.56 and 1.18, compared to 3.04 and 1.13 after. Pineda's K% improved from 22% to 26.7%. Minnesota non-tendered the 31-year-old righthander but quickly signed him to a two-year contract. Pineda will return to the Twins' rotation after missing the remaining 39 games on his suspension. If he can maintain his strikeout gains, Pineda's low WHIP and potential for wins render him a mid-tier fantasy starter."

He's expected to be healthy to begin 2020, and should occupy a late-inning role for his new team across town, the Mets surely regarding him a fallback option should closer Edwin Diaz struggle for the second straight year. Before the injuries, Betances was riding a record five-straight seasons of at least 100 strikeouts in relief, so there's reason to believe he can contribute to fantasy teams even in a setup role. Select him for holds, Ks and the ERA/WHIP help, with those most valuable in leagues with daily transactions."

The right-hander is armed with a mid-to-upper-90s fastball that occasionally touches triple digits and possesses late movement. However, it would be a stretch to say that Alcantara has put it all together, as his secondary offerings remain works in progress, limiting his ability to keep hitters off balance and thus generate strikeouts. It's fair to want better than Alcantara's 18.0 K%, given his ability to throw heat, though that number did jump to 20.0% over the second half of the campaign. Further improvement is dependent on Alcantara's continued growth in terms of both consistency and command. He's far from a true ace but may head up the Marlins' staff in 2020."

He's an imposing pitcher with a high-90s sinker, which with his size has helped him generate many grounders throughout his professional career and makes him a low-risk pick, even with as little experience as he has. May should be in the mix for a Dodgers rotation spot, but even if he remains in a swingman role, can contribute enough to warrant late-round mixed league consideration. It's also perhaps your last chance to secure him on the cheap in dynasty leagues."

In his 29.2 healthy innings he found a good deal of success, finishing with a 2.12 ERA and 1.01 WHIP. It took a .225 BABIP and an 89.6% strand rate to get him there, however, and his 3.52 FIP and 4.28 xFIP tell a considerably less impressive story. His 27.7 K% and 9.2 BB% aren't close to elite closer material. He probably won't have to be anywhere near elite to keep the closing job all season for a Pirates team that lacks quality alternatives. Still, injury worries and character concerns affect his job security, limiting him to the lower tier of closing options this draft season."

Unfortunately, the success was fleeting as Gausman was released in early August after posting a gaudy 6.19 ERA in 16 starts. The Reds claimed the right-hander and inserted him into their bullpen where Gausman thrived despite a 4.07 ERA, sporting a 1.16 WHIP with 29 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings, walking just five. The Giants signed Gausman after the Reds let him go following the season. The plan is for Gausman to return to starting, hoping the pitcher-friendly dimensions of Oracle Park spur a career rejuvenation. There's reason for optimism as homers have always been an issue for Gausman -- see his career 13.5% HR/FB mark. If Gausman fails as a starter, he's proven capable of transitioning back to a reliever."

He moved into that role in the second half of last year, picking up five saves before being shut down due to blood clots. Manager Bud Black elected to go with experience over performance, however, naming veteran Wade Davis his closer at the start of camp despite Davis' miserable 8.65 ERA last season. Given how much better Oberg pitched in 2019, it's easy to see him reclaiming the job fairly early in the year, placing him near the top of the list of non-closing relief targets. That's not to say he'd be an elite closer if given the position. His career-best 26.0 K% last season hardly jumps off the page, and he still calls Coors Field home."

Collectively, his 2.47 ERA was more than a full run better than any mark he had previously posted as a reliever. Even better, that ERA shrunk to 1.44 over 25 innings with Washington, the team he will pitch for again in 2020. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be cautious about overhyping Hudson's performance, as his 5.08 xFIP hints at likely regression. The right-hander is unlikely to see a repeat of his .247 BABIP or 81.8 LOB%, as both numbers fall far outside his career norm. Furthermore, Hudson's strikeout rate was an unimpressive 23.4% despite a fastball that clocked in at more than 96 mph. Hudson is likely to fall behind Sean Doolittle in the bullpen pecking order anyway, limiting his fantasy value to leagues that count holds."

He thoroughly dominated the Double- and Triple-A levels, posting a combined 1.10 ERA and 36.7% strikeout rate in 13 starts and two relief appearances, and in three of his 11 big-league starts despite frequently riding the Triple-A shuttle he posted Bill James Game Scores of 66 or greater. McKay's long-term ceiling is high and he should factor into the Rays' 2020 plans, more so on the pitching than hitting side, though he's a dual-eligible you can use in the latter if he factors into the DH or first base mix on certain days. He's a worthy late-round stash."

Those control issues revealed themselves in the majors as well; he had only three quality starts and the fifth-worst walk rate (10.7%) of any pitcher who made at least 10 starts from the date of his July 3 debut forward. Cease will need to address that if he's to break through in 2020, but he does have electric stuff once he clears those hurdles. He's an AL-only flier, and more of a dynasty-league prospect than a redraft target."

His 3.35 ERA suggests he acquitted himself very well, but the rest of his stat line tells a very different story. The 1.58-run gap between his ERA and his 4.93 FIP was more than half a run larger than any other qualified starter, leaving the door open for a precipitous fall this season. The Cardinals are a strong defensive team, and a pitcher with Hudson's high 56.9% groundball rate is well-positioned to take advantage of that defense, but defense can't reliably cover for the faults of a pitcher with an 18.0 K% and a 11.4 BB%. Expect a more mediocre ERA to go with Hudson's low strikeout total this season."

The right-hander made 25 starts, posting a 3.95 ERA (4.51 FIP) and a .234 BAA. For the first time in his career, he was an above-average strikeout pitcher, as his 23.0 K% was nearly three ticks higher than his 2018 mark. The improvement was partly due to a gain in his fastball velocity, which averaged 93.5 mph last season. He also did well limiting hard contact, holding opposing batters to an 87 mph average exit velocity. In what may have been a precursor to his 2020 role, Bassitt logged five scoreless innings out of the bullpen near the end of the campaign, striking out nine. Pitching in relief would help solidify Bassitt's place in the majors but would put a significant dent in his fantasy value."

Houser mainly pitched in the minors and in relief over the first half of the season, but he spent the final three months in the rotation, and when it was all said and done, he was one of the Brewers' best pitchers in 2019. He was particularly good to close out the campaign, posting a 3.02 ERA, 1.03 WHIP and 9.8 K/9 over his last 10 starts. Houser mainly relies on a mid-90s fastball and his curveball, but also mixes in a slider and changeup, so he has enough options to keep hitters guessing. With the way he finished last season, he heads into the 2020 campaign with a firm grasp on a spot somewhere near the top or in the middle of the Brewers' starting rotation."

Small sample, yes, but combining those with his six minor league rehabilitation starts, he had 34 K's compared to 10 walks, which at least offers some promise entering 2020. Now 34, Cueto is almost assured a rotation spot with the Giants for so long as he's healthy -- a $21-plus-million salary will do that for you -- and if he's looking good during spring training, he'd be worth a deep-mixed or NL-only mid-to-late round pick based upon his past track record."

Before the operation, he had posted good (yet hardly elite) numbers as a member of the Yankees rotation, leaning more to the matchups side in fantasy leagues as indicated by his 3.61 ERA against sub-.500 teams in his career to date. Montgomery will be an important pitcher to watch in Grapefruit League play, especially as he competes for a rotation spot following James Paxton's injury.

He began the season with the Giants, posting a 5.68 ERA and 1.61, starting the majority of the time. San Francisco dealt Pomeranz to the Brewers at the trade deadline. Perhaps encouraged by Pomeranz ending his Giants tenure with 5.1 innings of scoreless relief, along with their own conversion of Josh Hader to the bullpen, Milwaukee used Pomeranz as a reliever, and he registered a sparkling 2.39 ERA and .91 WHIP with 45 whiffs in 26.1 innings. The southpaw signed with the Padres, an organization known for getting the most out of their bullpen. Pomeranz is one of the top options in leagues scoring holds and can help support ratios and add strikeouts in standard leagues."

The 23-year old held his own in his freshman year before being shut down in mid-August with elbow inflammation. Prior, Canning tossed 90.1 innings and fanned an impressive 96 batters. The right-hander features a four-pitch arsenal including a 93-mph fastball, curveball, slider and changeup. However, he had only a five-mph delta between his heater and changeup, limiting the effectiveness of each. Canning's best strikeout pitch is his slider, which generated a 22.3% swinging strike rate last season. The Angels fortified their staff in the offseason, but Canning is still expected to fill a mid-rotation role. He was throwing in November, so the elbow issue cutting short his rookie season was minor and won't affect his availability for spring training."

Last year's save leader, Emilio Pagan, was shipped to San Diego, potentially opening up more ninth-inning opportunities for Castillo, even though his numbers can't compare with Nick Anderson's eye-popping stats. Then again, this is the Rays we're talking about, so creative pitcher usage is to be expected. Castillo's numbers don't match the game's truly elite relievers, but he's still a legitimate late-inning weapon. In 125.1 career innings, he has posted a 3.30 ERA, a 28.5 K% and a 8.6 BB%. In leagues deep enough to roster a handful of non-closing relievers, Castillo is a prime target, as whatever saves he manages can be taken as a bonus.

When Oberg's season was cut short in mid-August, Davis got another crack at the job, but it was short-lived after a blown save. He finished the season in low-leverage scenarios, where he's likely to remain for the 2020 season. Davis' strikeout rate was its lowest since 2013 when he was a starter for the Royals, and his walk rate was a career worst. Now 34-years old, there's little hope of a turnaround."

He showed improvement with both his four-seam fastball and curveball in the process, things that could put him in better position to claim the team's open fifth-starter job this spring. Any Grapefruit League success could thrust him into the late-round NL-only discussion, so monitor his progress."

He posted a surprisingly effective stat line. In 19 August/September appearances, he had a 3.00 ERA, a 1.11 WHIP and a 29.9% strikeout rate, even going 5-for-6 converting save chances in his month-long stint in the role. Magill enters 2020 as the favorite for ninth-inning duties, and the tweaks he made while with the Mariners make him worth a late-round pick if you end up waiting on saves."

The ERA estimators say Porcello deserved better in his final season in Boston, but not much better. His walk rate held steady at 5.9%, but his strikeout rate fell five percentage points to 18.6%. His home-run rate shot back up to 1.6, right around where it was in the first modern juiced-ball year of 2017. While Porcello had a 21.3 K-BB% in September, he still got knocked around, and aside from spin rate, there's little in his seasonal numbers to hang your hat on. At least Porcello remains durable, clearing 170 innings in 11 straight seasons. There is value in that volume in certain points-based formats. Porcello signed a one-year deal with the Mets over the offseason, and those looking to preserve their ratios in rotisserie leagues will want to steer clear, or at least stream Porcello carefully early on."

He was the team's lone representative in the All-Star Game and finished second in American League Rookie of the Year voting. The southpaw racked up 12 wins on the season -- more than 20% of the team's total -- while posting a 3.60 ERA. Advanced metrics were not as encouraging, as Means' 5.48 xFIP exceeded his ERA by nearly two runs, thanks largely to a massive 50% fly ball rate and a poor 19.0 K%. Still, Means did many things well, including limiting hard contact -- per FanGraphs, the 27.5 Hard% opponents registered against him was the top mark in the league (minimum 150 innings) -- and notching a stellar 6.0 BB%. That softens the harsh xFIP considerably, though Means isn't very appealing as a fantasy target due to his low strikeout numbers and frequent tough matchups in a loaded division."

The baseball itself isn't the only thing to blame. Happ's Zone% fell to a career-low 38.8%, and his strikeout rate plummeted six percentage points. The left-hander battled biceps tendinitis late in the season and played a minimal role for New York in the postseason, throwing just 3.2 innings across three appearances (zero starts). Now 37, Happ faces a somewhat uncertain future -- there were rumors that the Yankees were looking to trade him during the offseason. He would likely have more security in a starting role elsewhere. With the Yankees, Happ will have a short leash in the rotation. Happ may be best suited for bulk relief duty at this stage, given his third-time-through-the-batting-order numbers in recent seasons."

Blessed with a fastball that sits 96-97 mph and a hard curveball which he used as his primary pitch last season (50.7% usage), Barnes was able to strike out batters at a career-high 38.6% clip in 2019, ranking sixth among qualified relievers. He managed that lofty strikeout rate despite one of the 10 worst Zone% among that same group (35.9%). With all of those balls landing outside the strike zone, Barnes' already-unsightly walk rate ticked up to 13.3%. He got a save in his first appearance of the season but was passed over for the full-time closing job in favor of Ryan Brasier, and later on, Brandon Workman. Alex Cora is gone, but interim manager Ron Roenicke has already said he's sticking by Workman to begin the year, leaving Barnes for the list of possible speculative stashes on draft day."

He turned in four quality starts in his first six tries, locking down a permanent spot, holding his own over 21 total big-league turns. Plesac should hold that spot into 2020, but his underlying metrics raise concerns: 4.94 FIP, .255 BABIP, 39% ground ball rate, 39% hard contact rate allowed.

Despite awful 2019 results, he improved his walk rate significantly, slashing it to 5.4% in his eight second-half starts in fact, and boosted his average fastball velocity slightly, offering further promise. Mahle would have to open eyes during spring training to be more than a bench stash, but for the time being he's a wise one to make in NL-only leagues."

Sanchez has enjoyed an unlikely career renaissance over the past couple years since making the cut fastball a bigger part of his arsenal. He still does not miss many bats (18.8 K% last season), but Sanchez has done a better job of inducing soft, playable contact for the defense behind him. In fact, Sanchez ranked among the top 15% of the league (to the good side) in average exit velocity and hard-hit rate allowed, per Statcast. Now entering the final guaranteed year of his deal with Washington, Sanchez will be back to anchor the No. 4 spot in the rotation and should be viewed as a viable, if unexciting, staff filler in fantasy leagues."

In between, he also battled ulcerative colitis and saw his ERA rise to 4.84 -- more than a run higher than the 3.62 mark he posted in 2018. That Gibson hurled 160 innings despite dealing with illness is admirable in itself and likely explains the right-hander's second-half struggles (5.92 ERA, .307 BAA). Not all went south for Gibson last season, however, as his 3.80 xFIP was a career best. He also continued to evolve as a strikeout pitcher, registering a 22.7 K% and 13.1% swinging-strike rate -- both career highs. That bodes well for a bounceback 2020 campaign if Gibson is able to manage his ulcerative colitis and adjust to his new ballpark in Texas. Consider him a streaming option in mixed fantasy leagues."

He took over as the ace of Oakland's staff last season and compiled a sterling 15-4 record that included the second no-hitter of his career. However, it's rarely wise to get worked up over a pitcher's win percentage, and that certainly holds true for Fiers, as he posted a career-worst 5.19 xFIP last season due largely to an elevated fly ball rate (38.8%) and paltry 16.7 K% (fourth lowest among qualified starters). The luck factor was almost certainly in play for the right-hander in 2019, as he registered an abnormally low .254 BABIP and a surprisingly high (considering his lack of swing-and-miss stuff) 78.5 LOB%. Pitching in Oakland softens some of Fiers' risk factor, but he is nonetheless more likely to regress than progress in 2020."

He struggled mightily while at Triple-A Tacoma, posting a 6.87 ERA in 12 starts and a relief appearance early in the year, but exploded for a 2.19 ERA in 12 starts following a demotion to Double-A Arkansas to ultimately earn a seven-start, big-league audition with the Mariners. While there, Sheffield's control wavered, continuing to have the look of a capable strikeout artist with a good ground-ball rate yet one who is wildly inconsistent.

It ended up being a successful season for Kelly all things considered, as he threw 183.1 innings, the 12th most in the NL, and was worth two wins above replacement by FanGraphs' WAR. He had some homer issues but did not exacerbate those problems with walks (7.3 BB%). Kelly was not as valuable in the rotisserie game, as he was a detriment to the ratios, at least for the bulk of the year. He tapped into something extra over the final month and finished with a 2.18 ERA, .202 BAA and 35:11 K:BB in 33 September innings.

After signing a one-year deal with the Dodgers, Treinen will look to recuperate some value before hitting the open market again next winter. His velocity held steady, but Treinen's command and control were way off -- likely due in part to the injuries -- with his Zone% falling more than six percentage points to 37.8%. That was one of the 20 worst marks among 158 qualified relievers. He was adamant after signing that he's ""not a broken pitcher"" and that 2019 was an outlier.

A free agent after the 2019 season, Harris signed with the Nationals where he'll join the defending World Series champions as a setup man. Harris' strikeout and walk rates remain consistent and solid, though his hard-hit rate inched up last year. He throws a cutter and curve, with increasingly more use of the bender in each of the past two campaigns. Harris sits behind both Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson in the saves hierarchy, but since neither of his teammates are the bastion of health, Harris could get some ninth-inning duty at some point in the 2020 season."

In shorter stints, his low-to-mid-90s fastball and slider can make him an innings-gobbling, ERA/WHIP/K's helper even in mixed leagues, but as a rotation member they leave him more susceptible to the matchups, best illustrated by his 86 point career wOBA split.

He reported to Astros spring training healthy and with an adjustment to his mechanics, making him a name to watch as spring training unfolds.

The ERA estimators are less kind to him on account of his low 18.3 K% and high 1.54 HR/9. Eflin does a good job against right-handed hitters but continues to have problems with lefties; he has allowed a .366 wOBA to lefty batters in his career, and that number sat at .356 in 2019. Of the 28 homers he served up last season, 17 were to lefties. He has good sinking movement on his fastball, but at this point it seems he may never develop a pitch to neutralize southpaw sluggers. Philadelphia has not made any major additions to its rotation, so Eflin projects to open the season in the rotation. Until further notice, Eflin is only a streaming option.

Once a fairly prolific groundballer, he became more of a flyball pitcher in 2019. The soft-tossing righty was lucky that the change, combined with the juiced ball, did not lead to a spike in homers; Statcast says Davies overachieved in the SLG department by more than 50 points and FIP says he overperformed his ERA by a full run. The other popular ERA estimators, namely xFIP and SIERA, are even harsher on Davies, saying he deserved an ERA north of 5.00. He managed just a 15.2 K% and had the second-lowest Zone% among regular starters last season (min. 150 IP). It wasn't the first time Davies outpitched his peripherals, having also done it by a significant margin in his 17-win 2017 season, but it's tough to bank on that trend continuing. Following an offseason trade to the Padres, Davies sees a park upgrade but likely loses some run support."

His ERA swelled to 7.09 in his final six outings for Erie, a sure sign that he'll begin 2020 in the minors, proving his full health as well as continued dominance of the minors' upper levels before earning that promotion.

In his final five starts, Miley posted an unsightly 16.68 ERA and 3.09 WHIP with seven walks to just six strikeouts in only 11.1 innings. The September swoon cost Miley a spot on the playoff roster. After signing with the Reds, it will be seven organizations in as many seasons for the nine-year veteran. The return to the Senior Circuit also comes with a reunion with pitching coach Derek Johnson. The two were together in Milwaukee, where Miley posted his best season, albeit in only 80.2 innings. Now 33 years old with mediocre stuff, Miley is best suited for NL-only formats with bench spots."

For the second straight campaign, Milwaukee picked him up as a midseason acquisition in 2019, and there he found his groove, registering a 2.45 ERA and collecting seven wins over 11 starts. That led Texas to sign him to a two-year, $16 million contract in the offseason, but there are reasons to be wary of the success he found late last season. For one, his xFIP was 4.91, nearly double his stellar ERA. In addition, he was helped by an unsustainable .225 BABIP and 87.8 LOB%. Finally, Lyles' past performances leave much to be desired, as he owns a career 5.11 ERA (4.52 FIP) over more than 900 innings. Perhaps a rearrangement of his arsenal and increasingly better strikeout rates have revived his career, but it makes sense to tread lightly."

While that did not dramatically affect his velocity, there's some thought that his release point was off and his extension was limited. Obviously it's impossible to quantify the impact the injury had on his numbers. After Arrieta had the spur removed, he will be looking to get back to the form we saw in 2017 and 2018. Arrieta was far from being the ace he used to be, but he was still an above-average major-league starter in 2017 and 2018, capable of providing wins and decent ratios on a good team. The strikeouts probably aren't coming back (18.5 K% last year) and you'll want to pick your spots early on, but you could do worse in the endgame."

He had as good an ERA as a starter (2.89) as in relief (3.00), but couldn't miss nearly as many bats in the former role (20.9% K rate, compared to 27.1% in relief). Gonsolin should be in the race for a roster spot this spring, but might have to settle for long-relief/swingman work yet again. He has intriguing skills, but is probably more of a scoop-him-up type only when moved into the rotation."

His first 11 starts went swimmingly, as he recorded a 3.43 ERA and 1.08 WHIP over initial 60.1 innings. Things went downhill from there, though as Kikuchi registered a devilish 6.66 ERA and 1.78 WHIP the rest of the way. After allowing a reasonable eight homers in his first 11 games, Kikuchi surrendered a whopping 28 long balls over his final 101.1 frames. Known in Japan for his velocity, Kikuchi averaged a so-so 92.5 mph on his fastball, with only 15th-percentile spin. He also throws a slider, curve and changeup, with only the changeup (barely) rating as a plus-pitch. Kikuchi has the reputation of being a heady pitcher, so perhaps he can adjust. Heading into the season, though, he caps out as a streaming option in fantasy leagues."

He had 27 holds last season as Alex Colome's primary setup man, and should be the White Sox's go-to left-hander in the seventh and eighth innings again in 2020. Bummer lacks a closer's ceiling, though, so expect a repeat of the holds and consider anything else gravy."

The lanky lefty continues slinging the slider home at increasing rates, and it is now his primary pitch. His fastball velocity has lost a few ticks over the past few seasons, but the slider is still a strong pitch for him and the source of most of his strikeouts. His 30% strikeout rate looks closer-worthy, but on a contending team, his WHIP and home run rates simply will not play in the ninth inning. Carlos Martinez wants to become a starter, but Giovanny Gallegos has the better skills to take over the closer role. Draft Miller for strikeouts, vultured wins and spot saves and you will not be disappointed."

This included six starts in center field and 29 total appearances in the outfield. Thanks to a tweak to his pitch selection and the return of his 97-mph average fastball velocity, he struck out a career-best 24.8% of the batters he faced, putting himself directly in the late-inning mix behind closer Raisel Iglesias. Lorenzen should occupy a similar role entering 2020, piling up the holds, with plenty of K's and solid ratios.

He did not break camp with the Yankees and chose to opt out of his minor-league contract in late April, ultimately landing back with Milwaukee. While the lefty spent time on the injured list with arm issues, he fared reasonably well when on the field, continuing his strong run after first joining the Brewers 2018. His strikeout rate ticked back up and Gonzalez kept his home-run rate right around 0.9 HR/9, which is an especially strong mark considering the run environment and the home park he pitched in. The White Sox saw enough to commit $5 million to the veteran. He probably won't be afforded a long leash if he struggles, and the injury concerns aren't going away at his age, but Gonzalez looks like a viable streamer pitching in a bad division."

While that might have explained his 19.2% walk rate for his new team, anything in double digits represents a poor mix for a pitcher with a 48% career fly-ball rate. Stanek can miss bats, but he'd be a shaky bet to close, especially with Brandon Kintzler now on the roster. Consider Stanek an NL-only pick or one who could help with holds, but only if it's throwing more effectively first during spring training."

In the process, he completed the year with nine holds, a 1.38 ERA and 0.73 WHIP in his final 24 appearances, giving himself a legitimate chance at entering 2020 as Raisel Iglesias' primary setup man. Stephenson's skill set is now on par with that of the game's better closers, making him one of the more intriguing speculative saves picks come draft day, but he's plenty capable of helping you in holds, ERA, WHIP and K's even if he remains in setup relief."

He gave up 24 runs over a span of four starts from late April to early May and was moved to the bullpen. A lack of fastball command was pointed to initially as the reason for his removal from the rotation, but McHugh hit the IL with elbow soreness shortly thereafter. He also ended the year on the injured list with elbow issues, so it's fair to wonder if his arm ever felt fully right in 2019. The Astros gave up hope for a postseason return and formally shut McHugh down Sept. 17 with ""continued pain"" in the elbow.

With that role somewhat wide open entering 2020, Diaz could factor into the late-inning mix, armed with a high-90s fastball, sinker and slider that all performed well in 2019.

It turned out to be the right move: Buttrey's 41% Statcast hard-contact rate ranked in the bottom 20% among pitchers, something he'll need to correct if he's to take the next step as a possible finisher.

Weeks after tossing a scoreless inning in the All-Star Game, the right-hander was moved to Atlanta, where he was expected to take over as the team's closer. Things didn't go as planned, however, as Greene was relieved of ninth-inning duties after blowing two saves and giving up five earned runs in his first five appearances with the Braves. Though he eventually settled down, Greene never reclaimed the closing role. There are things to like about the 31-year-old -- among them, a career-best 6.7 BB% last season -- but his below-average fastball and middling 11.5% swinging-strike rate don't fit the profile of a shutdown closer.

First it was Tommy John surgery, performed in February of 2017. He made it back to St. Louis in the summer of 2018 but made just a single appearance before going down with a torn lat tendon, which also required surgery. Last season, a broken pinkie finger and a strained pectoral muscle conspired to limit Reyes to 40.1 total innings. The lack of durability has forced him into a relief role for 2020 and likely beyond. He has the stuff to be a major weapon in the bullpen and could eventually close, but this year will be mostly about proving he can stay on the field and contribute to the big-league squad."

Not coincidentally, both his strikeout rate (17.0%) and swinging-strike rate (8.2%) headed in the wrong direction, and even his solid 6.5 BB% was his highest mark since his rookie campaign.

Strahm was rocked in his first few starts back from the IL and subsequently moved to the bullpen. The Padres announced in February that Strahm will work as a reliever in camp, so it seems like the ship has sailed in regards to him being a starter at the major-league level. In the bullpen, Strahm has a 2.71 ERA and 27.9 K%, much better than the 5.06 ERA and 24.1 K% he has posted as a starter.

Granted, his outstanding 2019 season came on the heels of an injury-riddled 2018 but, when healthy, Kahnle has exhibited elite strikeout skills (albeit with inconsistent control). The right-hander battled shoulder and biceps issues two years ago, resulting in a loss of velocity. Kahnle's fastball regained its zip, though he used it less last year, relying more on his change-up. The adjustment worked as he avoided the IL, appearing in a career-high 72 games.

He is all fastballs and sliders, so the approach makes him tough on righties, but more susceptible to opposing lefties, at the plate. For his career, left-handers have reached base 36% of the time against Keller while righties have done so 29% of the time. Keller outings generally follow a pattern of him pitching carefully to lefties and letting his stuff play up against righties. The approach leads to a poor WHIP and a reliance on batted-ball outcomes to bounce his way. Ideally, he would be a reliever who shuts down opposing right-handers, but as a starter in Kansas City he is only draftable in deep AL-Only leagues."

The implication was he'd be able to maintain his success, but once again, Coors Field flexed its muscles, claiming another victim, as Freeland more than doubled his 2018 ERA, posting a bloated 6.73 mark in 22 starts. Even a trip to Triple-A Albuquerque didn't help, as he posted an 8.80 ERA in six starts for the Isotopes. The Rockies will give Freeland another shot in the rotation, but he'll need to upgrade a fastball with 34th percentile velocity and curve with 17th percentile spin to miss more bats and elicit weaker contact."

Anderson was demoted to Triple-A Albuquerque but didn't take the mound for the Isotopes, as it was determined he needed season-ending knee surgery. Colorado let Anderson go in the off-season, and he was subsequently claimed by the Giants. San Francisco also released Anderson but brought him back as a free agent. The lefty won't be ready until at least May, but the extreme upgrade in venues puts Anderson on the watch list as well as a potential stash in leagues with a deep reserve or an IL spot."

Still mostly a fastball/slider pitcher with low velocity, Junis has struggled against lefty batters without that viable third pitch to combat them, and home runs have been a problem against both righties and lefties, and not just last year in a juiced-ball season. He is still only 27 years old, but there is really nothing in the underlying profile to get excited about. Junis has cleared 175 innings in back-to-back seasons and that volume does have value in certain points formats. In rotisserie leagues, Junis' appeal is minimal."

After posting an encouraging 3.07 ERA and 1.10 WHIP with 58 strikeouts in 41 frames for Lehigh, Pivetta returned to the majors but continued to struggle, eventually moving to the bullpen.

The results were unspectacular -- particularly after the All-Star break, when he posted a 5.09 ERA over his last 13 appearances -- but he still pitched well enough to be included in an offseason trade that landed him with the Brewers. Lauer does not have dominant stuff, but he got by mainly with a fastball/cutter mix last season and has three other pitches in his arsenal. He's going to have to do a better job keeping runners off bases to bring more to the table in fantasy leagues, but the Brewers have had a lot of success in recent years getting the most out of pitchers with a similar profile. Lauer will not start Opening Day for a second straight year, but he's a safe bet to break camp with a spot somewhere in the rotation."

His 4.63 ERA since the start of 2018 is the 13th-worst mark among the 90 pitchers who have thrown at least 250 combined innings over the past two seasons. His 1.41 WHIP in that span ranks sixth worst among that group. The veteran lefty's strikeout rate has hovered right around 20% for three seasons now, and his xwOBA on contact has been above .390 in three of the past four seasons. He spent time on the injured list with a left hamstring strain and has missed extended time in pretty much every year of his career, exceeding 155 innings only once. Some deep-league owners will inevitably stream Duffy at great risk to their ratios. A trade to a better team could help, but it's not worth speculating on. Throw that dart elsewhere on draft day."

He has come back as an extreme pitch-to-contact hurler who surprisingly pitched better on the road (3.22 ERA, 1.15 WHIP) than he did at home (4.67 ERA, 1.49 WHIP.) One would assume Anderson's style would have suited Oakland's cavernous territory perfectly, but it did not. Anderson was much more effective against lefties last season, holding them to a .221 BA and .588 OPS, but righties teed off to the tune of a .280 BA and a .780 OPS. Home/road splits aside, the move to Milwaukee is a curious one given how harsh Miller Park can be on pitchers who struggle with their stuff, and the expected stats paint an unfavorable future for Anderson. A move to the bullpen at some point feels all but certain."

His groundball, home-run and K-BB rates hardly budged, and Wainwright's WHIP remained north of 1.40. Lefty batters were a problem last year, but Wainwright at least held his own when he had the platoon edge, limiting right-handed hitters to a .297 wOBA. A few years ago, Wainwright famously called into a fantasy radio show to argue his worth in rotisserie baseball, but we'd like to believe even he would see the argument for a mixed-league roster spot as a losing cause at this stage.

While he wasn't one of the Cardinals' primary set-up men, he chipped in with a dozen holds, also a personal best. Brebbia pitched more than one inning on 24 occasions, so he shouldn't be impacted by the new reliver usage rules. The 29-year old righthander is an extreme fly ball pitcher but has only surrendered 11 homers in 123 1/3 innings over the past two years. Working 67 1/3 innings in Busch Stadium has helped him keep the ball in the yard, but he's still due some regression.

The two lucky elements last season were a .261 BABIP and an 8% home run-per-fly ball mark. Sure enough, both regressed and then some, though the 2019 funky ball didn't help. Williams' 17.8% strikeout clip puts him at the mercy of batted-ball fate.

The right-hander still finished with an 11-1 record and just a 2.9% opponents' barrel rate, ranking in the top 2% of the league in that statistic. Gant added more than two ticks to his fastball and his changeup induced swinging strikes nearly a quarter of the time. It's clear that Gant can be a very good major-league reliever, but the 11 wins are not repeatable and he will need to find his way into saves to be worthwhile outside of deep leagues. The door is open with Carlos Martinez wanting to move back into the rotation, but Giovanny Gallegos and Andrew Miller are both in the mix as well."
Craig Stammen,RP,Padres,76.0,0.0,82.0,15.0,73.0,8.0,4.0,31.0,3.29,1.16,8.01,21.0,0.0,24.0,7.0,22.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,4.13,1.25,8.25,"Over the last two seasons, only two players earned more holds than Stammen: Adam Ottavino and Tony Watson. In 2019 Stammen racked up 31 holds, tying for the major-league lead in the category, while posting his third straight season with an ERA under 3.30. In leagues counting holds, Stammen remains very much in the mix after he returned to San Diego on a three-year, $12 million deal in the offseason. In standard-scoring leagues, Stammen looks best left for the waiver wire as potential save chances are now well out of reach. He just does not have the strikeout punch (21.5 K% last year) to be worthwhile if he is not seeing save chances. Stammen does a great job limiting walks, but he only averages 92-93 mph on his fastball and there are now two more electric arms ahead of him -- Drew Pomeranz and Emilio Pagan -- behind closer Kirby Yates."
Sergio Romo,RP,Twins,65.0,0.0,60.1,17.0,60.0,2.0,20.0,17.0,3.43,1.11,8.95,22.0,0.0,21.0,7.0,27.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.86,1.19,11.57,"The versatile Romo served as both a closer and a setup man between stints with Miami and Minnesota last season, notching 20 saves and 17 holds while posting a 3.68 FIP. The right-hander will be 37 on Opening Day, but he is less prone to hitting an age wall due to his reliance on soft stuff. Romo's fastball settled in the mid-80s last season, and his primary pitch -- a slider -- was among the slowest in the league with an average velocity of 77.4 mph. Fortunately, hitters have trouble hitting Romo's pitches hard. In 2019, opponents managed a meager 84.6 mph average exit velocity against him, 11th lowest in the league (minimum 50 plate appearances). That, along with Romo's ability to limit walks (6.8 BB%) and fool hitters with off-speed stuff (14.1% swinging-strike rate), inspires confidence that he can again be an effective late-inning option."

As evidence, his ERA the first time through the lineup in 2019 was 2.84, the second time through it climbed to 4.41, and the third time through it blew up to 9.26. Norris allowed 15 of his 22 home runs the second and third time through a lineup last season, and his opponents' batting average jumped from .259 the first two times through to .323 when he was left out there too long. Even bad teams need pitchers to soak up innings to give the bullpen a break, which explains why Norris piled up 23.1 third-time-through innings that damaged his overall numbers. He would be rosterable in some formats if Detroit promised never to extend him."

After rehabbing, Plutko was summoned to the majors in mid-May, going on to start 20 games as the Indians suffered several injuries to their rotation. Plutko is a fly-ball pitcher with good control, but he's not dominant so he's even more susceptible to the long ball. In fact, he surrendered 22 round-trippers in just 109 1/3 frames. Plutko will compete with Aaron Civale and Zach Plesac for two rotation openings and will likely end up on the outside, looking in. Even if he captures a spot, low strikeouts and a high ERA driven by home runs isn't a fantasy friendly combination."

This explains why the Marlins are hell bent on finding a role for Urena and his 86th percentile (95 mph) sinking fastball. Control and the inability to develop secondary pitches have curtailed his development. Last season, Urena posted a 4.58 ERA and 1.45 WHIP in 74.2 innings as a starter, fanning only 51. After missing time with a back injury, Urena spent September as a reliever, recording a 9.00 ERA and 1.70 WHIP, albeit with 11 punch-outs in 10 frames. Urena, the Marlins' Opening Day starter the past two seasons, is expected to be stretched out in the spring. He wouldn't be the first to have something click, but it's only worth paying to find out in deep formats where streaming pitchers is a tactic."

His 23% strikeout rate was lower than usual but his bloated 15.3% walk rate and a high .346 BABIP resulted in an excess of base runners and, hence, runs. Even his pristine HR rate swelled to 1.05 HR/9 -- still low but more than double his career 0.50 mark. Familia's velocity dropped a tick to 96 mph, but it was the complete loss of command and control doing the damage. Even with the increased benefit of a dominant middle reliver in today's fantasy landscape, there are better options out there than relying on the hope that Familia regains some effectiveness."

Last season, it bottomed out as Godley was banished to the Diamondbacks' bullpen after posting a 6.67 ERA and 1.59 WHIP after five starts. After recording a 5.36 ERA and 1.33 WHIP as a reliever, Arizona cut bait. Godley was claimed by the Blue Jays, with whom he logged a 4.82 ERA and 1.55 WHIP before being waived and outrighted to Triple-A Buffalo to finish the season. Detroit signed Godley to a minor league deal. Rebuilding teams are a good landing spot for reclamation projects, your fantasy roster is not."

Jason Vargas,SP,FA,30.0,29.0,149.2,63.0,124.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,4.51,1.36,7.46,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vargas' 2019 season will probably be remembered for one thing: he threatened to beat up a Mets reporter. His performance on the field was forgettable, with the lefty posting a 7-9 record for the second straight year. Two of the top estimators, xFIP and SIERA, say Vargas should have had an ERA north of 5.00 on account of his middling strikeout (19.1%) and walk (9.7%) rates. He fell behind in the count more often and his chase rate dipped. After Vargas posted a 5.19 ERA in the second half, the Phillies -- who acquired Vargas from New York in a July trade -- declined his option, choosing to pay Vargas $2 million to get out of town rather than $8 million to pitch for the team in 2020. At age 37, Vargas can probably eat innings for a second-division team if he chooses to return for another season."

Upon his eligible return, he should slide back into the rotation, where for 12 starts and a relief appearance to begin his 2019 he was on track for one of the season's biggest pitching breakthroughs, his ERA 3.86, WHIP 1.11 and strikeout rate 26.7% during that time. After a near-month-long IL stint for a hip injury, he wasn't quite as dominant, with 4.19/1.18/25.1% numbers that seem more realistic going forward. Despite his early absence, German is worth stashing in mixed leagues for the season's final four months, but be forewarned that you'll have to do so with him on your bench, which can be limiting in ESPN's three-bench-spots standard."

The decreasing volume is especially troubling, since his lone strength at this point in his career is the ability to accumulate strikeouts. The veteran ranked in the bottom 20% among pitchers who threw 100 or more innings last season across various categories, including FIP (5.02), walk rate (10.5%) and HR/FB (20.2%). The swing-and-miss stuff is still there -- Archer posted a strong 27.2 K% and 12.9% swinging-strike rate last season -- but that's not enough to balance an ERA that has increased each of the past four years, ballooning to 5.19 in 2019. The strikeout numbers are tantalizing, but given the injury concerns and overall downward trend of Archer's career, he's best viewed as a streaming option in mixed fantasy leagues."

A disastrous second half brought Price's FIP up to 3.62, though that was still a better mark than in his previous two seasons. It's reasonable to assume that the cyst in Price's left wrist that brought his campaign to a premature end played a part in his second-half struggles. He posted enough encouraging signs throughout the season -- including a career-best 27.9 K% and a typically solid 7.0 BB% -- to suggest that he still has plenty to offer on the mound. Health has been a question mark for Price in the late stages of his career, but with the cyst removed and a full offseason to rest, he could significantly outperform his ADP."

Before the operation, he was one of the top pitching prospects in the game, capable of reaching 100 mph with his fastball while sporting solid breaking pitches, but he had some issues with control in the minors and had an extreme fly-ball leaning in a four-start audition with the big club in 2018. Kopech has never exceeded 140 2/3 innings in any season as a pro and therefore might be handled conservatively by the White Sox, but the shortened schedule alleviates many of those worries. He might quickly capture a big-league rotation spot and the high upside that'll come with it. Monitor him closely, stash him for now and regard him a great dynasty-league prospect."
Emmanuel Clase,RP,Indians,21.0,1.0,23.1,6.0,21.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.31,1.11,8.1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clase will serve an 80-game suspension for testing positive for Boldenone, effectively ending his 2020 before it started, though the league has announced the remaining 20 games of the penalty will not carry over into 2021."
Mike Leake,SP,Diamondbacks,32.0,32.0,197.0,27.0,127.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.48,1.29,5.8,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the emergence of Zac Gallen last season and the addition of Madison Bumgarner in free agency, it looks like there will be only two rotation spots available between Leake, Merrill Kelly and Luke Weaver. In terms of big-league experience, Leake is head and shoulders above the other two. On merit, Leake is arguably last among those three options. His groundball rate declined seven percentage points over the past two seasons, and the balls that got up did more damage in 2019, with Leake posting by far the worst home-run rate of his career (1.87 HR/9). He continues to rank among the best starters in walk rate (just a 3.2 BB% last year), but the strikeouts have never been there. If the home runs remain at last season's level, Leake won't be long for a starting role in the big leagues."

Mike Trout,OF,Angels,470.0,110.0,45.0,104.0,110.0,120.0,11.0,0.294,0.44,0.647,1.087,151.0,34.0,12.0,29.0,35.0,39.0,5.0,0.298,0.44,0.609,1.0490000000000002,"The current holder of the title ""best baseball player on the planet"" makes a compelling case for the same claim in fantasy baseball, though Trout's injury absences over the past three seasons have made that a bit debatable. He has missed 85 games, including absences due to a pair of IL stints for thumb and wrist injuries, as well as surgery to remove a neuroma from his right foot last September. However, it's not expected to delay his start to the 2020 season. All that said, Trout's performance around his absences hasn't been merely excellent -- it has been Hall of Fame good. He was baseball's leader in home runs (45), OBP (.437) and ISO (.353) at the time of his injury last year, and is the only player in baseball to hit at least 100 home runs and steal at least 50 bases while batting .300-plus in the past three seasons combined. Clearly Trout can be the best player in fantasy with more luck in the health department. That keeps him as strong a choice at No. 1 overall as anyone. It's only a debate entering 2020 because of the quality of the challengers' pool."
Christian Yelich,OF,Brewers,489.0,100.0,44.0,97.0,80.0,118.0,30.0,0.32899999999999996,0.429,0.6709999999999999,1.1,198.0,40.0,12.0,36.0,28.0,47.0,9.0,0.313,0.40399999999999997,0.5710000000000001,0.975,"Yelich has flourished in his two seasons with the Brewers, and probably would be riding a back-to-back National League MVP award streak if not for the broken kneecap that prematurely ended his 2019 with 18 games left on the schedule. He had already declared himself fully healed in January, so except in the event of a spring setback, he'll be one of the top three candidates to start off your rotisserie draft, and at least top five in points-based leagues. Don't attribute all of Yelich's success to the significantly more hitting-friendly Miller Park confines as he has dramatically improved his overall hitting game since his trade from the Marlins. Most importantly, Yelich cut his ground ball rate from 56% in his final year in Miami to a career-low 43% in 2019, while also boosting his average exit velocity to a personal-best 93.1 mph. About the only potential negative we see is the possibility of more red lights on the base paths, as the Brewers recognize how important his bat is to their cause. Even that shouldn't be a dramatic drop considering his 30 steals were a career high and he has averaged 19 over the past six seasons."
Ronald Acuna Jr.,OF,Braves,626.0,127.0,41.0,101.0,76.0,188.0,37.0,0.28,0.365,0.518,0.883,212.0,42.0,15.0,33.0,25.0,64.0,12.0,0.278,0.361,0.542,0.903,"The closest player to a 40/40 season in eight years -- he fell three steals shy and might have done it, if not for a left groin strain that cost him the final three regular-season games -- Acuna will be a popular choice for anyone picking first overall. He brings an appealing combination of youth/potential growth, power/speed and beneficial circumstances as the projected leadoff man for the overall seventh-best scoring offense (third in the National League) from 2019. Both Acuna's quality of contact and raw speed metrics grade among the league's elite, so he's as good a bet to deliver on the first-round investment as anyone in baseball. That said, he's not entirely without flaws. He has a lot of holes in his swing, missing on more than 30% of his cuts after the 2019 All-Star break alone, putting his batting average at risk and leading to strikeouts that eat into his points-league production. In fact, last year, he was the No. 2 player on rotisserie teams, but only No. 16 in points formats. Keep that mind if you play the latter format, but in the former, Acuna is one of the three most logical candidates to begin your draft."
Cody Bellinger,"OF, 1B",Dodgers,558.0,121.0,47.0,115.0,95.0,108.0,15.0,0.305,0.406,0.629,1.035,194.0,40.0,14.0,40.0,31.0,43.0,4.0,0.294,0.392,0.588,0.98,"A spike in his contact rate, which improved by nearly eight full percentage points -- among the largest single-year jumps this century -- fueled a 2019 National League MVP campaign for Bellinger. In the process, he became only the sixth player in history to bat at least .300 with 45-plus home runs at the age of 23 or younger, showing that he's now a complete, across-all-formats fantasy baseball first-rounder. Only one thing now stands in his path to future No. 1 overall status -- consistency. His first-half .336 batting average and .448 wOBA slipped to .263/.370 after the All-Star break. Bellinger might find that consistency, but even if he continues to exhibit ups and downs, the ups bring tops-in-the-game fantasy production and the downs are probably at worst top-50 caliber, in part because he's capable of contributing a decent handful of stolen bases."
Mookie Betts,OF,Dodgers,597.0,135.0,29.0,80.0,97.0,101.0,16.0,0.29600000000000004,0.392,0.526,0.9179999999999999,211.0,45.0,11.0,30.0,32.0,33.0,8.0,0.299,0.389,0.531,0.919,"This is what a ""down"" year for Betts looks like: No. 20 on the Player Rater, No. 10 in fantasy points. Struggles squaring up the ball in April and May led to a sluggish start to 2019, but the 27-year-old star batted .323/.399/.588 over his final 80 games, with fantasy production in line with his best-in-rotisserie 2016 and 2018 campaigns. In the process, he upped his line-drive rate to an astonishing (and admittedly unsustainable) 35% during that same span, resulting in the majors' third-best expected wOBA. This is proof positive that when he's right, he's capable of being the No. 1 player in any fantasy baseball format. Betts' prospective managers might be scared off by his ""off year,"" or by his move to the more pitching-oriented NL or into a pitching-friendly ballpark in Dodger Stadium. Don't be fooled! He's an unquestionable first-round pick in every league, with a real chance at reclaiming the No. 1 hitter spot."
Francisco Lindor,SS,Indians,598.0,101.0,32.0,74.0,46.0,98.0,22.0,0.284,0.335,0.518,0.8540000000000001,209.0,36.0,12.0,27.0,19.0,33.0,8.0,0.287,0.34600000000000003,0.536,0.882,"The 2019 season represented a slight pull-back for Lindor, who finished 29th on the Player Rater and tied for 40th in fantasy points after 12th/10th finishes in 2018. In his defense, he did that despite missing the season's first 19 games because of left ankle and right calf strains. Over the past three years, though, he has slashed .278/.342/.514 while averaging 34 home runs, 85 RBIs, 21 stolen bases and 110 runs scored, rarely straying from any of those individual numbers in any single season. Trade rumors surrounded Lindor throughout the offseason, but that might only serve to deflate his draft stock, which remains first-round caliber due to his five-tool ability. His elite defense fuels a massive number of plate appearances -- his 2,122 over the past three seasons is 50 more than anyone else -- making him one of the best return-on-investment selections that early."
Juan Soto,OF,Nationals,542.0,110.0,34.0,110.0,108.0,132.0,12.0,0.282,0.401,0.5479999999999999,0.9490000000000001,185.0,38.0,12.0,38.0,37.0,44.0,3.0,0.297,0.413,0.562,0.975,"Soto's career is off to a Hall of Fame-caliber start, and while his defense could still use some polish, his offense -- the part we fantasy managers care about -- only seems to be getting better. As a 20-year-old in 2019, he managed a top-10 finish in OBP (.401), OPS (.949), walks (108) and runs created (128). He concluded his year with a .276/.405/.606 slash line (with 13 home runs and 39 RBIs) in the Nationals' final 50 regular-season games before following it up with a .277/.373/.554, five-homer postseason. In the process, he boosted his average exit velocity and launch angle by significant amounts while cutting his ground ball rate from 55% to 43%, a sign that he's growing into an elite slugger at little to no expense to his batting average. Soto brings enough upside to the table to warrant first-round consideration -- and certainly so in points leagues, where his many walks strengthen his value. He's a foundation piece for dynasty/keeper leagues."
Alex Bregman,"3B, SS",Astros,554.0,122.0,41.0,112.0,119.0,83.0,5.0,0.29600000000000004,0.423,0.5920000000000001,1.015,192.0,38.0,12.0,35.0,34.0,29.0,2.0,0.28600000000000003,0.39799999999999996,0.557,0.956,"The runner-up for American League MVP honors in 2019, Bregman's batting eye is easily the sharpest in baseball. He was the MLB leader with 119 walks and had the lowest miss rate on his swings (16%). He also had an 85% contact rate that put him in the top 20. These make Bregman a sabermetric and points-league darling, where he was the highest-scoring hitter and third overall scorer. In short, he is one of the safest first-round selections in rotisserie leagues. At the same time, he enjoyed some good fortune on fly balls, with his 41 home runs being a tad unusual for his batted-ball profile. He also got fewer green lights on the base paths. Expect some pull-back in Bregman's numbers, especially in light of the Astros' involvement in the sign-stealing scandal this offseason. How wide might the impact end up? That remains unclear, but he remains a talent who shouldn't be escaping the first round."
Trea Turner,SS,Nationals,521.0,96.0,19.0,57.0,43.0,113.0,35.0,0.298,0.353,0.49700000000000005,0.85,214.0,36.0,7.0,23.0,19.0,43.0,14.0,0.294,0.353,0.47200000000000003,0.825,"Underrate Turner's speed at your peril. Statcast has graded him top-six in baseball in terms of sprint speed in each of his five big league seasons, something only he and Byron Buxton can claim. Only Turner has amassed 30-plus steals in the majors in each of the past four seasons. In this era of declining SB totals and homer-happy baseballs, it's the speedsters who come at a premium -- especially one like Turner who has other very fantasy-worthy skills. If you took away all of his steals, he'd have still finished among the top 140 overall players in either rotisserie or points-based leagues, and his .316/.368/.518 season-finishing slash line in 53 games showed that he might be ready to flourish with the bat as he begins the 2020 season at the age of 26. He might be a shakier second-round selection in points-based leagues because of the nature of speedsters in that scoring system, but there's no doubt he's worth the pick in a rotisserie league. In fact, he might be ready to reclaim his former status as a solid first-rounder."
Nolan Arenado,3B,Rockies,588.0,102.0,41.0,118.0,62.0,93.0,3.0,0.315,0.379,0.583,0.9620000000000001,209.0,35.0,14.0,41.0,23.0,36.0,1.0,0.306,0.373,0.569,0.9420000000000001,"Arenado has been one of the most consistent players in the game, posting a wOBA between .371-.395 and a wRC+ between 121-132 over the past five seasons. His overall wOBA since 2015 is .387, 11th best among qualified batters. The corresponding wRC+ is 127, which drops him to 34th overall. This is important since wRC+ is park neutral, giving a better idea of where Arenado might fall if he's traded out of Colorado. In fantasy terms, he's currently a late-first/early-second round player. If traded, he becomes an early-third/mid-fourth rounder, depending on the venue and quality of offense. This bakes in a small penalty in rotisserie leagues for his limited steals contribution, which is a desired commodity in today's landscape. In points leagues, Arenado's rank is better as a result of a decent walk rate and low strikeout totals."
Trevor Story,SS,Rockies,588.0,111.0,35.0,85.0,58.0,174.0,23.0,0.294,0.363,0.5539999999999999,0.917,212.0,33.0,13.0,33.0,19.0,64.0,5.0,0.27399999999999997,0.33799999999999997,0.5379999999999999,0.875,"Story is coming off back-to-back seasons with at least a .290 batting average, 30 home runs and 20 stolen bases -- the only shortstop in baseball history who can make that claim. He's seemingly a foundational fantasy piece in the format, but make no mistake that he's also a bit of a Coors Field product. He has a career road wOBA (.323) 87 points lower than at Coors (.410), and he had at least a 93-point home/road wOBA split in both of those two big years. Fortunately for Story, his two-year contract extension signed in January practically guarantees him a full 81 games at Coors yet again, but it's something daily league or head-to-head fantasy managers should keep in mind. After all, those extended road trips might be tougher to endure than those of an average player. He's still a second-round caliber talent in rotisserie, but is more of a lower-end member of the top 40 in other formats."
J.D. Martinez,"OF, DH",Red Sox,575.0,98.0,36.0,105.0,72.0,138.0,2.0,0.304,0.38299999999999995,0.557,0.9390000000000001,196.0,34.0,13.0,38.0,24.0,51.0,1.0,0.306,0.381,0.5710000000000001,0.953,"The 2019 season was an interesting one for Martinez. He has clearly enjoyed his time in Boston, and last season enjoyed nothing more than facing lefties, as he hit .404/.494/.887 against them in 170 plate appearances. Unfortunately for Martinez, he was barely league average against righties with a .272/.344/.449 line in 486 plate appearances against them. It was the first season in his full-time career in which Martinez had such low numbers against righties. Martinez has no peers when it comes to pulverizing lefty pitching, so a rebound against righties could lead to another huge year. He controls opt-out clauses in his contract but has a limited no-trade clause and Boston is looking to control costs. A move out of Fenway and the cozy AL East parks would be unfortunate because he is tailor-made for the park and the division."
Rafael Devers,3B,Red Sox,647.0,129.0,32.0,115.0,48.0,119.0,8.0,0.311,0.361,0.555,0.9159999999999999,221.0,37.0,11.0,35.0,18.0,48.0,1.0,0.281,0.336,0.511,0.847,"A return to the 80%-plus contact rates he exhibited in the lower minor league levels (back in the early days of his pro career) spawned a massive breakthrough for Devers in 2019, as he obliterated his previous single-year pro bests in almost every offensive category. He showed an ability to hit both for average and power, with the only negative marks on his otherwise extraordinary campaign being the .229/.289/.405 slash line over his final 30 games and the 23.4% strikeout rate he had in September. Given that Devers at the time was a 22-year-old whose 156 games played were 12 more than he had in any previous professional season, we're willing to forgive the slump -- especially in light of his substantial skills improvements over the course of the full season. He's a player who might still have room to grow, meaning that a second consecutive year as a member of fantasy baseball's top-20 talents could yet be in the cards. Draft accordingly."
Bryce Harper,OF,Phillies,573.0,98.0,35.0,114.0,99.0,178.0,15.0,0.26,0.37200000000000005,0.51,0.882,188.0,36.0,13.0,39.0,36.0,57.0,4.0,0.266,0.386,0.532,0.9179999999999999,"One of the most divisive players in all of baseball, Harper's first year in Philadelphia is probably unfairly regarded a disappointment in the context of the monstrous free-agent contract he signed. The truth is that he has now been a top-50 overall finisher on the Player Rater for three consecutive seasons (one of only 13 players to do so). He could well have claimed the same status in points-based leagues if he had scored only two additional points in 2017, when he finished exactly 51st. Perhaps it's not the ""by far best in the game"" status many predicted when he was selected first overall in the 2010 amateur draft, and Harper's .260-or-below batting averages in three of the past four seasons do leave a sour taste. Still, he has quietly become one of the more reliable sabermetrically-inclined hitters in baseball. In addition, he finished his first year for his new team slashing .277/.372/.598 with 17 home runs and a perfect 10-for-10 in steals over his final 51 games, so perhaps he's due for a boost now that he has fully adapted to his new surroundings. Harper isn't the first-round-caliber talent we had hoped for, but he's also not a player to let slip outside the top 25 picks of any draft."
Freddie Freeman,1B,Braves,597.0,113.0,38.0,121.0,87.0,127.0,6.0,0.293,0.387,0.546,0.9329999999999999,176.0,31.0,12.0,32.0,24.0,38.0,1.0,0.301,0.389,0.585,0.9740000000000001,"There might not be a more consistent, higher-floor hitter in all of baseball right now than Freeman. In the past five seasons alone, he's the MLB leader in line-drive rate. He also finished in the top 20 in batting average, home runs, wOBA, RBs and runs scored. He's a top-eight performer among left-handed hitters in terms of wOBA against both righties and lefties. It's that stable return on investment that props Freeman up into the second round of any fantasy draft -- and arguably into a borderline first-rounder -- with the declining 1B talent pool also bolstering his value. Other than the bone spurs in his right elbow that hampered his September and required offseason surgery, Freeman comes with few questions. Considering that all offseason reports on his recovery were positive, that one seems to have a fair answer."
Anthony Rendon,3B,Angels,545.0,117.0,34.0,126.0,80.0,86.0,5.0,0.319,0.41200000000000003,0.598,1.01,193.0,34.0,11.0,38.0,27.0,31.0,1.0,0.301,0.389,0.565,0.9540000000000001,"The Angels signed Rendon to a seven-year, $245 million contract during the offseason, dropping him into a loaded top four of their lineup that might ultimately afford him the chance to repeat 2019's career-bests of 126 RBIs and 117 runs scored. A lot of things went right for Rendon last season, but he also continued to show the kind of incremental growth he has made for the past half-decade, with his personal-best .320/.404/.592 slash rates against right-handers particularly impressive. This is a third baseman at his peak, one who finished 12th on the Player Rater and sixth overall in total points in 2019, cementing his status as a universal second-round pick. That said, there's a lengthy history of slow starts -- even if only for a couple of weeks -- when it comes to league-switching stars, so if you invest in Rendon, be patient if he adds to that historical trend."
Jose Ramirez,3B,Indians,482.0,68.0,23.0,83.0,52.0,74.0,24.0,0.255,0.327,0.479,0.8059999999999999,199.0,30.0,10.0,32.0,25.0,28.0,8.0,0.276,0.35700000000000004,0.513,0.8690000000000001,"Every year, some name-brand fantasy talent has an inexplicably catastrophic first half. In 2019, it was Ramirez. He slashed .214/.309/.325 in 80 games through June, done in by a .232 BABIP and 4.2% HR/FB rate, both of those ranking among the seven worst qualifiers. With his underlying skills still visibly intact, he rebounded in a major way thereafter, batting .321/.356/.722 with 18 homers and 53 RBIs in 49 games. A fractured right hamate cost him 26 games, but that was the only hiccup during that span. While it might be natural to assume a ""meet in the middle"" analysis of his polar-opposite halves, Ramirez's base skills suggest that his second half was much closer to his true self than his first, though his extreme fly-ball lean and a slight uptick in strikeouts do suggest that a return to a .300 batting average might not be in the cards. If Ramirez's prospective fantasy managers see his final stat line as a sign of decline and let him slip several rounds in your draft, scoop him up. Relative to the ADP, he's one of the stronger bounce-back candidates entering 2020."
Starling Marte,OF,Diamondbacks,539.0,97.0,23.0,82.0,25.0,94.0,25.0,0.295,0.342,0.503,0.845,183.0,33.0,8.0,27.0,9.0,35.0,7.0,0.29,0.33799999999999997,0.508,0.847,"With the move from Pittsburgh's PNC Park to Arizona's Chase Field, Marte's power bump of 2018-19, hitting 20-plus home runs in each, now seems locked in as an annual expectation. Even with the presence of the humidor, Chase represents a significant boost for him from an offensive standpoint, strengthening Marte's odds of a third consecutive 20/20 campaign -- he's currently one of only five players to hit at least 20 homers and steal at least 20 bases in each of the past two years. In fact, in a typical year, 25/25 wouldn't be out of the question, and it's possible that's undercutting his stolen-base potential. Marte might not feel like a foundational fantasy piece, but in this era of declining steals totals, his numbers warrant it: He has been a top-30 performer on the Player Rater in each of the past two years, a locked-in draft candidate in the first 2-3 rounds. In points-based leagues, though, he has finished a more modest-yet-respectable 81st and 63rd in fantasy points in those seasons, so keep in mind that he's a little less valuable there."
Javier Baez,SS,Cubs,531.0,89.0,29.0,85.0,28.0,156.0,11.0,0.281,0.316,0.531,0.847,207.0,34.0,10.0,35.0,11.0,60.0,3.0,0.275,0.314,0.507,0.821,"Baez provides a good reminder that all performance indicators need to be evaluated together. Based on plate skills, Baez appears to be a batting-average liability. However, his combination of an 84th-percentile average exit velocity and an 86th-percentile sprint speed yields a hit rate well above that usually associated with his 28% K-rate and 5% BB-rate. That said, the whiffs keep Baez's average in the .270-.290 range, so to warrant a top-20 ranking, he needs volume and stolen bases. The 27-year-old shortstop is usually durable, though he missed last September because of a hairline fracture in his thumb. That leaves steals as the key. Baez has the speed but was just 11-for-18 on stolen base attempts last season. If you're using an early draft pick on him, you're hoping new manager David Ross gives him the green light and that Baez improves his success rate. That's a risky proposition."

This was the norm at his peak value, having done so for six consecutive seasons. Five-category producers are great, but they have to play a lot to maximize their production, and Altuve has not played as often the past two seasons. He, like many in 2019, had his most productive power season, setting a new career high in homers, but 2019 was a down year for him in the other offensive categories. Most concerning is six consecutive seasons of decline in the running game, as his stolen-base total has fallen from 56 in the middle of the decade to just six last season. This could be his final year of five-category production, as he enters a new phase of his career."
George Springer,OF,Astros,479.0,96.0,39.0,96.0,67.0,113.0,6.0,0.292,0.38299999999999995,0.591,0.9740000000000001,199.0,41.0,14.0,35.0,26.0,45.0,2.0,0.281,0.371,0.5479999999999999,0.919,"Springer is coming off a career year in terms of rate stats, though the fantasy impact was dampened by him missing a month early on with a sore hamstring. Fueling Springer's career-high 39 homers was a new personal-best 29.5% HR/FB mark, nearly double the previous year's level. Springer's fly ball rate also ticked up for the fourth consecutive season. The main cause of the power surge was the highest average exit velocity on fly balls of Springer's career. This measurement was not influenced by the physical characteristics of the 2019 ball, so if Springer can maintain that added authority, the power gain can be maintained, unlike with a batter more reliant on the extra distance resulting from reduced air resistance. Durability is a concern, but Springer's power is approaching elite levels."
Pete Alonso,1B,Mets,597.0,103.0,53.0,120.0,72.0,183.0,1.0,0.26,0.358,0.583,0.941,191.0,35.0,16.0,42.0,25.0,61.0,0.0,0.24600000000000002,0.353,0.55,0.902,"In this era of teams manipulating service time to buy additional years of control for their young, up-and-coming stars, it was refreshing to see the Mets hand Alonso their Opening Day 1B job last March, though his .352 spring batting average with four home runs surely helped his cause. Alonso rewarded the Mets with a rookie-record 53 home runs despite playing home games in a pitching-friendly ballpark. Alonso established himself as one of the game's premier power hitters. He'll be hard-pressed to follow up with as stellar a season, though, considering he became more free-swinging after the All-Star break. Perhaps that was merely the result of knowing he was in pursuit of history, but he batted just .235 with a 28.7% strikeout rate and struggled with breaking and off-speed pitches. It's common sense to expect some regression of Alonso's home run rate, but he's still capable of being a top-five fantasy first baseman and a top-40 pick overall."
Charlie Blackmon,OF,Rockies,580.0,112.0,32.0,86.0,40.0,104.0,2.0,0.316,0.366,0.578,0.9440000000000001,183.0,35.0,10.0,25.0,15.0,35.0,1.0,0.306,0.366,0.563,0.929,"Blackmon rebounded from a down season (by his standards) to bat better than .310 and slug at least .550 for the third time in four seasons. He scored 100 runs for the fourth consecutive campaign, despite playing only 140 games, his lowest total since becoming a regular in 2014. The lost time was due to an early-season calf strain, costing the veteran 14 games. Other than vanishing steals, Blackmon is displaying no signs of a skills decline. His 2019 strikeout rate was his lowest since 2016, while his average exit velocity was its highest since Statcast began collecting data in 2014. As usual, Blackmon's home splits were extreme, but barring a trade, Coors Field will be his home through at least 2021. Take the ""boring guy"" discount and bank one of the more stable and reliable options in the game."

It was the second such injured list stint for the young phenom; he also missed 38 days earlier in the year with a left hamstring strain, with the ailments the largest worry surrounding him entering 2020, particularly in light of his all-out style of play. Still, consider his major league rankings at the time of the back injury: ninth in batting average, slugging percentage and wOBA, and one of only five players with at least as many as his 22 home runs and 16 stolen bases. Now 21, Tatis' ceiling is potentially the sky, with plate discipline his only other likely obstacle beside health. Optimists can make a viable case for a first-round pick in a rotisserie league, or a top-25 pick in points-based, but the realist will and should wait a couple rounds longer."

That earned him top-25 finishes on both the Player Rater and in terms of fantasy points scored, after he had been more of a top-50 performer in the three seasons that preceded it. Bogaerts' solid contact rate, line-drive stroke and placement in the heart of a productive Red Sox lineup makes him a strong bet to replicate his three-year average, even if a 2019 redux might be difficult due to its massive volume. Don't let him slip far past the first three rounds/30 picks of your draft."
Gleyber Torres,"SS, 2B",Yankees,546.0,96.0,38.0,91.0,48.0,129.0,5.0,0.28,0.33799999999999997,0.537,0.875,197.0,31.0,12.0,32.0,18.0,50.0,2.0,0.27399999999999997,0.335,0.503,0.8370000000000001,"Quite a few things went right for Torres in 2019: a homer-friendly home ballpark, homer-happy baseball, a professional high in plate appearances (by 53 over 2018) and 19 divisional games against the Orioles' awful pitching staff, against whom he slugged 1.045 and hit 13 of his 38 home runs. That's not to discount the performance, as he was well above average in terms of average exit velocity and Statcast's barrel rate, showed practically no platoon split, shaved nearly 4 full percentage points off his strikeout rate and did this all at age 22. Torres is only just coming into his own, and he's in fabulous circumstances to fill the pertinent fantasy categories as a member of the potent Yankees in that park. More consistency might be the final step toward becoming a true top-25-overall fantasy superstar, which is what should keep him on your draft board a round or two longer, but it's also not unthinkable he could accomplish it in 2020."
Ozzie Albies,2B,Braves,640.0,102.0,24.0,86.0,54.0,112.0,15.0,0.295,0.35200000000000004,0.5,0.852,223.0,34.0,8.0,26.0,17.0,42.0,5.0,0.278,0.33299999999999996,0.475,0.809,"After an uneven first two seasons in the majors, both of which nevertheless concluded with good-looking final stat lines, Albies appears primed to take the next step forward in 2020. He boosted his walk rate from 5.3% to 7.7%, his Statcast average exit velocity from 86.3 to 88.8 mph and stroked 29% line drives after the All-Star break, signs that he was finally flourishing at the plate after enduring some early-career adjustments. As is, Albies finished 2019 the No. 37 name on the Player Rater and 35th in fantasy points, so he's already in the mix for a universal third-round selection even if he merely spins his wheels. Keep this in mind as you seek his upside: He made 63 of his 157 starts in the Nos. 6, 7 or 8 spots in the lineup, but he'll be in the top third this year, which should continue to boost his plate appearance and runs scored totals."
Manny Machado,"3B, SS",Padres,587.0,81.0,32.0,85.0,65.0,128.0,5.0,0.256,0.33399999999999996,0.462,0.7959999999999999,205.0,28.0,11.0,32.0,22.0,40.0,2.0,0.273,0.34299999999999997,0.488,0.831,"Here's a theory: Machado hasn't been as disappointing as perceived. Instead, expectations were unfairly elevated after his 2015 campaign. We saw a guy with power and speed, playing in a great park with a chance to get better. The truth is, Machado is a very good player who was aided by volume (averaging 702 plate appearances from 2015 through 2018) and Camden Yards, plus an outlier 2015 season with respect to steals. Last season's perceived dip was mostly the result of moving into a park that suppresses offense. Machado's underlying metrics were similar to previous campaigns, with a slight dip in hard-hit rate and an increase in strikeouts, both bolstering the detrimental park effects. With a year in San Diego under his belt, Machado's skills are likely to rebound, but unless the Padres pipe in humidity and bring the fences in, Petco Park will continue to hinder his production."
Yordan Alvarez,DH,Astros,313.0,58.0,27.0,78.0,52.0,94.0,0.0,0.313,0.41200000000000003,0.655,1.067,163.0,28.0,12.0,36.0,23.0,50.0,1.0,0.276,0.36700000000000005,0.564,0.9309999999999999,"One of the most impactful, yet abbreviated, rookie seasons in the game's history, Alvarez's 2019 captured the rookie record for OPS (1.067) among those with at least 250 plate appearances. He joins Trevor Story as having the only two debut campaigns of at least 25 home runs in fewer than 100 games played. He's already one of the game's most feared power hitters at age 22. He managed top-15-in-baseball rates in terms of average exit velocity (92.2 mph) and barrel rate (10.3% of his trips to the plate), per Statcast data. He also got a good amount of lift on the ball and had practically no platoon split (just 15 points of wOBA). Still, the Yankees appeared to solve the Alvarez mystery in the American League Championship Series, holding him to a .045 batting average and whiffs in half his trips to the plate. While ""small sample"" could be the caveat, it's important to note that he batted just .152 against curveballs and had 41 of his 94 total K's against all breaking pitches. Toss in the Astros' implication in the sign-stealing scandal -- he had a 61-point wOBA home/road split -- and there are reasons to hedge your bets. Alvarez's power potential is still that of a top-50 rotisserie pick, but his K-friendly nature should keep him on draft boards far longer in points leagues."
Anthony Rizzo,1B,Cubs,512.0,89.0,27.0,94.0,71.0,86.0,5.0,0.293,0.405,0.52,0.924,172.0,28.0,8.0,32.0,25.0,28.0,1.0,0.297,0.406,0.506,0.912,"Rizzo played through back troubles and yet was able to put up another solid year of offensive production, even though he failed to drive in 100 runs for the first time since 2014. It is a shame the back got in the way of taking advantage of 2019 baseballs, as he could have had a monster season if healthy. Rizzo hit 19 of his 27 homers before the break but spent the second half focused on hitting for average, as he raised his batting average 55 points in the second half, recognizing the physical challenges were limiting his ability to drive the ball over the fence. He is a solid four-category producer as long as the back issues are behind him, but now in his 30s, they may linger. There is no statistical worry, as he has a very high floor in both production and skills."

Conspicuously absent is Cruz, who belongs in the same conversation. In fact, last season the veteran slugger led all qualified hitters in exit velocity on fly balls. One of these years, taking advantage of the utility-only, old-man discount will backfire, but we're still talking about a guy averaging 41 homers over the past six seasons. Cruz's playing time has dipped for five consecutive years, but he will turn 40 in June, so some health risk comes with the territory. Bake positional flexibility into the rest of your hitters and don't hesitate to fill the utility spot with a batter deserving of being drafted much earlier or costing far more in an auction."
Ketel Marte,"OF, 2B",Diamondbacks,569.0,97.0,32.0,92.0,53.0,86.0,10.0,0.32899999999999996,0.389,0.5920000000000001,0.981,215.0,32.0,8.0,29.0,19.0,32.0,3.0,0.28800000000000003,0.34700000000000003,0.493,0.84,"Where did that come from? Marte was an absolute sensation last season, and while it's easy to attribute much of his success to the rabbit baseball, grant him this: He batted .300-plus in five of the season's six months, he greatly elevated his launch angle to back the power burst with a bit of a skills bump, and he posted by far the best hard-contact rate of his career (40%). There are hints here of a reasonable chance at a semi-repeat, though ""regression to the mean"" does lurk, and has a bit of legitimacy considering how perfect his year felt. Marte remains a five-category contributor in rotisserie leagues, keeping him among the top 50 overall talents there, and he's not much less valuable in points-based leagues because of his high contact rate."
Kris Bryant,"3B, OF",Cubs,543.0,108.0,31.0,77.0,74.0,145.0,4.0,0.282,0.382,0.521,0.903,199.0,39.0,10.0,28.0,27.0,53.0,1.0,0.281,0.382,0.49700000000000005,0.879,"Shoulder problems that plagued Bryant throughout the 2018 season thankfully subsided during a bounce-back 2019, as his 31 home runs was his second-best total in any of his five big league seasons. In the process, he (mostly) restored the average exit velocity and launch angle of his better years, but due to the continued loss of some of his line-drive ability and a bit of hard contact, his batting average slipped to a career-worst .262, something that threatens to stick going forward. Bryant nevertheless remains one of the better fantasy third basemen out there, and a slightly more attractive one in points-based leagues, where his keen eye at the plate carries enough value to warrant as much as a two-round draft bump. The problem is that third base is an extremely deep position this season, so beware that he's no longer an irreplaceable commodity."

Jimenez belted 31 home runs in a better-than-you-remember-it rookie 2019, but that 48% ground ball rate is going to need some reduction if he's going to truly grow into his power -- especially this year if there's any change to the baseball. Putting that aside, Jimenez presented plenty of hints at growth entering 2020, batting .292/.328/.542 with 15 home runs in 59 games after the All-Star break, including a .340 average and nine homers in 24 games in September alone. He was long considered one of the best prospects in baseball, a prime dynasty/keeper league target, and should take another step forward as a sophomore. Don't let him sneak out of the top 50 overall picks in any fantasy redraft."
Giancarlo Stanton,OF,Yankees,59.0,8.0,3.0,13.0,12.0,24.0,0.0,0.28800000000000003,0.40299999999999997,0.49200000000000005,0.894,161.0,30.0,15.0,33.0,21.0,55.0,0.0,0.267,0.355,0.596,0.951,"After back-to-back seasons of remarkably good health, the injury-prone version of Stanton returned in full force in 2019. The big slugger missed 141 of 162 possible Yankees games due to a pair of IL stints for left biceps and right knee sprains. A strained calf also dogged him during one of his rehab assignments and a quadriceps strain hampered him during the postseason, greatly reducing his over/under for plate appearances heading into 2020. Stanton did bat .278/.400/.486 with average exit velocity (94.2 mph) similar to his elite career norms in the 23 games (postseason included) that he did play, but that's hardly enough of a sample from which to judge. His raw strength and good eye at the plate represent a strong basis from which to regard him a top-25-overall talent in any fantasy format in each of the healthy games he plays, but how close to that status you draft him has entirely to do with how risk-averse you are."

He bucked traditional thinking that hamate bone injuries threaten a player's power even after his recovery, as the first baseman hit 36 home runs from his May 7 return date forward, fifth most in the majors. Olson's Statcast metrics fully supported his being one of the game's premier power sources, his hard-contact rate ranking among the game's top six, and his launch angle and Barrel rates ranking among the top 25. There's every reason to believe he can maintain the performance he did during the final five months of 2019 regardless of the composition of the baseball, locking him in as a clear top-75 overall pick in all formats."

Pham tied his career high in steals, and even improved his contact rate, but that was not reflected in his batting average. Pham went through a long spell in the summer when he had a ground ball rate over 60% because he pulled the baseball. He hit .212 on pulled ground balls last season, but expected stats say he hit those with enough quality of contact that he should have hit 40 points higher. Pham's outstanding plate discipline is why San Diego acquired him in a December deal, as the Padres were 26th in the league in on-base percentage last season. Pham should slot nicely in one of the top-two spots in the lineup and will be in position to score plenty of runs."

Between the ailments, he has remained one of the game's most fear-inducing power hitters. He has paced the majors in average exit velocity in each of his three full seasons in the majors. In those three years combined, he ranks fifth in ISO (.293) and eighth in total home runs (106) as well as HR-rate (6.5%). But don't cast Judge aside as an all-or-nothing slugger. His 267 walks from 2017-19 were seventh most in baseball, which buoyed his points-league value and fueled a sabermetrically sound .401 OBP. He was also the game's No. 12 overall performer in rotisserie and No. 16 in points-based in his record-setting, Rookie of the Year-winning campaign. Judge's stress fracture in his rib, dating back to last season, remained a big question mark at the time spring training resumed, so he's a tough pick in the early rounds without further optimism in his recovery."

Last season, the health consistency was there, the run and power production were there, but the steals once again faded, and the batting average fell off with the change of home venues and divisions, as he joined the Cardinals. Goldschmidt's expected batting average, according to Statcast, was just two points higher than his actual average, but his expected slugging percentage was 55 points better than his final number. He is no longer a five-category producer, as the steals are a thing of the past, but he is an excellent three-category producer with very stable plate skills. Batting average is fluky, and a rebound there would push him back into the top 40 overall."

In July and August alone, during which time he started 48 of 51 Brewers games, Hiura slashed .313/.386/.604 with 11 home runs, 34 RBIs and eight stolen bases. Nevertheless, he did struggle to make contact, as his 30.7% strikeout rate was 18th worst in history among rookies with at least as many plate appearances as his 348. That'll be the area of improvement -- as well as greatest downside -- for Hiura during his sophomore season, though the power growth and speed he showed suggest he shouldn't have a hard time competing for a top-10 fantasy stat line among second basemen."

The result was a .297/.387/.615 slash line and 28 home runs as a left-handed hitter, a near-4-degree boost to his overall launch angle and more than 2 full mph added to his average exit velocity, as well as 27 first-half home runs that earned him a place in the midsummer Home Run Derby. While some might attribute his .233/.351/.429, 10-homer second half to the ""curse"" that comes with that invite, Bell experienced poor fortune on batted balls and did struggle through an oblique strain. It's more likely than not that he can maintain his approach entering 2020, one that should earn him a place among the top 50 overall players in fantasy, and perhaps a round or so earlier in points-based leagues, where his patience and high contact rate are particularly valuable."

They'll utilize him all over the diamond, granting him a realistic chance at in-season fantasy eligibility at third base and outfield eligibility in addition to his current second base/shortstop combo. They'll also presumably continue to grant him green lights on the base paths, exploiting his greatest strength, as he has averaged 41 steals between the majors and minors the past five seasons. Let that drive your interest in him, and in this era of declining steals, Villar's speed coupled with his double-digit homer ability makes him a viable top-50 pick in rotisserie leagues. In points leagues, as is often the case with speed-oriented players, he's a bit -- perhaps as many as 3-4 rounds -- less valuable."
Eddie Rosario,OF,Twins,562.0,91.0,32.0,109.0,22.0,86.0,3.0,0.276,0.3,0.5,0.8,193.0,29.0,10.0,32.0,9.0,31.0,1.0,0.275,0.304,0.48200000000000004,0.7859999999999999,"For some, like Rosario, the strike zone is merely a suggestion. Last season, he swung at 46% of the pitches he saw out of the strike zone, well above the 31% league average. However, he made contact on 75% of those swings, well ahead of the 63% league mark. He's also aggressive inside the zone, though his contact there matches league norms. The result is an above-average contact rate, propping up his batting average floor. Rosario has narrowed his platoon splits, hitting southpaws for average but still deriving most of his power facing right-handers. Rosario is poor defensively, but with Nelson Cruz occupying the DH slot, Minnesota has no option but to let Rosario try to shag fly balls. He doesn't run, so there's limited upside there. Still, Rosario offers stability to a fantasy roster, providing three-category production with a non-detrimental batting average."
Whit Merrifield,"2B, OF",Royals,681.0,105.0,16.0,74.0,45.0,126.0,20.0,0.302,0.348,0.46299999999999997,0.8109999999999999,223.0,31.0,5.0,23.0,15.0,40.0,7.0,0.287,0.335,0.444,0.779,"After stealing 79 bases over the previous two seasons combined, Merrifield was a popular choice to offer speed to a fantasy roster -- one with a solid batting average without totally sacrificing power. Unfortunately, that plan backfired as Merrifield was an inefficient 20-for-30 on the basepaths, falling well short of expectations. His sprint speed declined from the mid-90th percentile to the 86th, but that doesn't seem like enough to account for the drop. The poor success rate probably led to fewer opportunities, rendering doubt as to whether Merrifield will pick up the pace, especially since he's now 31 and likely to lose another step. Further, during new manager Mike Matheny's tenure with St. Louis, the Cardinals swiped the second-fewest bags in the league, though a good skipper should accentuate a player's strengths. While Merrifield's batted-balls skills remain intact, he should no longer be counted on to provide a bountiful foundation of steals for a fantasy roster."
Eugenio Suarez,3B,Reds,575.0,87.0,49.0,103.0,70.0,189.0,3.0,0.271,0.358,0.5720000000000001,0.93,185.0,28.0,12.0,34.0,23.0,54.0,0.0,0.27,0.35700000000000004,0.519,0.8759999999999999,"Suarez made a legitimate run at the Reds' franchise record for home runs in 2019, sacrificing contact and going for an extreme fly-ball approach at the plate that resulted in 49 home runs, three shy of George Foster's 42-year-old mark. While Suarez was quite a find for his fantasy managers, his underlying metrics didn't entirely support the performance, unless he's willing to further surrender batting average in a quest to aim for the moon every swing. In short, be careful not to pay for a repeat, though he has arrived as one of the 10 best in fantasy at his position. Some spring homework: Keep tabs on Suarez's ongoing recovery from Jan. 28 shoulder surgery, as he'll probably be limited during the early stages and could be a candidate for the injured list to begin the regular season."
Austin Meadows,"OF, DH",Rays,530.0,83.0,33.0,89.0,54.0,131.0,12.0,0.29100000000000004,0.364,0.5579999999999999,0.922,174.0,26.0,10.0,27.0,16.0,42.0,3.0,0.287,0.354,0.54,0.894,"Meadows' 2019 was very inconsistent -- he had a pair of months with .310 or worse wOBA, and two others with .455 or better -- but the sum total of his efforts gave a lot of reason for optimism entering 2020. He nearly doubled his single-year pro best for home runs, with the metrics to fully support the boost, posted his best walk rate (9.1%) in three years with good patience metrics, and hit both righties and lefties, a crucial trait for a member of the matchup-conscious Rays. What's more, Meadows managed .294/.363/.619 slash rates with 17 home runs and 38 RBIs in his final 50 games, finishing his breakthrough campaign on a high note. If he can smooth things out, which isn't an unreasonable guess for a player entering his second full big league season, he might be able to take the next step toward a top-25 rotisserie -- and perhaps top-40 in points -- campaign."
Jose Abreu,"1B, DH",White Sox,634.0,85.0,33.0,122.0,36.0,152.0,2.0,0.282,0.32899999999999996,0.502,0.831,209.0,29.0,11.0,39.0,14.0,46.0,0.0,0.282,0.335,0.517,0.852,"It is tough to find players who consistently produce in fantasy baseball, but Abreu has been that guy throughout most of his career. His 2018 represented the one slip-up in his production, because it was the first time in his career that he missed time because of injury. The disappointing final numbers presented a nice buying opportunity for Abreu last spring, and he rewarded those who jumped back in on him handsomely, picking up right where he left off with his run production. The batting average is not what it was earlier in his career, but it is still above league average. Abreu is well-positioned to have another huge RBI campaign with Yoan Moncada and Tim Anderson hitting in front of him while being protected by Yasmani Grandal and Edwin Encarnacion behind him. The baseline is 30/100/.280 with room for growth."
Marcell Ozuna,OF,Braves,485.0,80.0,29.0,89.0,62.0,114.0,12.0,0.243,0.33,0.474,0.804,192.0,31.0,11.0,38.0,21.0,43.0,3.0,0.281,0.353,0.5,0.853,"Beware overrating Ozuna's raw numbers: His 2018 (23 homers, 3 steals) was actually the more valuable fantasy season than his 2019 (29 and 12), which shows the steep decline in home run valuations due to the rabbit baseball. His was a good-not-great campaign, with his four-year averages of 28 home runs, 94 RBIs, 4 stolen bases and a .277 batting average a better representation of his true talent. Now with the Braves on a ""pillow contract,"" Ozuna should hit in the heart of another productive lineup, with an underrated top three slotted ahead of him to support his quest at another 90-plus RBIs. He's well worth a pick in the early-to-middle rounds of any fantasy draft."
Marcus Semien,SS,Athletics,656.0,123.0,33.0,92.0,87.0,102.0,10.0,0.285,0.37,0.523,0.893,218.0,40.0,10.0,30.0,26.0,40.0,3.0,0.271,0.35,0.486,0.836,"Few players can boast the kind of overall improvement to their game the past two seasons as Semien. Formerly a defensive liability with modest pop, he has become one of the better shortstops with the glove, and he posted a professional-best 84.5% contact rate in 2019. Semien saw his fantasy point total soar by 205, earning him a spot in the top 10 overall, and he finished 91 spots higher on the Player Rater as well. He finished the season on quite a high note, slashing .313/.398/.645 with 16 home runs in his final 52 games, and while there's a likelihood of some regression in his numbers, his skills bumps shouldn't be discarded outright. Regard Semien as a top-10 fantasy shortstop in all formats, with the chance he could finish among the top five in points leagues."
Victor Robles,OF,Nationals,546.0,86.0,17.0,65.0,35.0,140.0,28.0,0.255,0.326,0.419,0.745,180.0,28.0,5.0,22.0,12.0,44.0,9.0,0.267,0.337,0.42200000000000004,0.759,"Robles' rookie season was a solid one -- top 100, at that -- in rotisserie leagues, but it wasn't without flaws. He generated a surprisingly low rate of hard contact (rating among the bottom 5% in the majors), posted the worst walk (5.7%) and strikeout rates (22.7%) of his professional career and hit only three homers in his final 60 games (backed by a near-50% ground ball rate). Those trends limit his points-league upside, making him more of a mid-round than a top-100 pick. Fortunately, Robles is young enough to improve, turning only 23 in May, and he did show a hint of pop in the early stages of 2019, not to mention he was a plus defender who should earn a maximum amount of playing time. Since he's a speedster, don't let him slip too far in your roto draft."
Matt Chapman,3B,Athletics,582.0,101.0,36.0,91.0,73.0,147.0,1.0,0.247,0.341,0.505,0.846,204.0,37.0,12.0,31.0,24.0,56.0,0.0,0.255,0.341,0.515,0.855,"Chapman continues to show growth at the plate, and considering he's one of the game's premier defenders, he'll continue to get a maximum number of plate appearances to drive his numbers home. For the second consecutive year, he improved his overall contact rate and ranked in the top-20 qualifiers in baseball in terms of hard contact rate, supporting his home run spike while suggesting that his .249 batting average might've been misleading. Chapman's skills have quietly become elite in points-based leagues, as he's a potential top-40 overall pick there after finishing among the top 60 in that format in 2019. He's also a highly attractive pick in rotisserie leagues, though, and should be drafted among the top 10 at his position."
Nicholas Castellanos,OF,Reds,615.0,100.0,27.0,73.0,41.0,143.0,2.0,0.289,0.337,0.525,0.863,211.0,33.0,10.0,30.0,16.0,52.0,0.0,0.289,0.34299999999999997,0.526,0.87,"Castellanos' finish to 2019, following his trade to the Cubs, was a thing to behold: He batted .321/.356/.646 with 16 home runs (tied for ninth most) and 43 runs scored (tied for fifth), finally tapping into the elite batting average and power combinations fantasy managers had been anticipating for years. Now with the Reds, he's moving to yet another favorable environment in which to hit, for an offense that should be significantly improved upon 2019's bottom-10 unit. The smart money, though, has Castellanos regressing off his hot finish, probably closer to his three-year averages of a .287 batting average and 25 home runs. He should be able to turn in those totals, ones worthy of a top-25 fantasy outfielder at the very least, and probably warrants a pick slightly sooner than that due to his recent signs of growth. One note: He came within nine doubles of the single-season record, something that had a lot more value in points-based leagues than you might think, as he finished 31 spots better in that format than in rotisserie leagues. Castellanos' extra-base hit ability is especially attractive in points leagues."
Adalberto Mondesi,SS,Royals,416.0,58.0,9.0,62.0,19.0,132.0,43.0,0.264,0.293,0.425,0.718,188.0,24.0,6.0,24.0,8.0,62.0,13.0,0.245,0.273,0.431,0.7040000000000001,"Mondesi's game is one of extremes. He had the majors' second-most stolen bases (43) despite appearing in only 102 games but also the second-highest swinging strike rate (22%). A separated shoulder that resulted from a diving play in mid-July and required offseason surgery ruined what was an otherwise productive campaign from a rotisserie perspective, and it underscored how much variance is involved in his game. A fully healthy Mondesi is capable of 60-plus steals -- that alone propelling him into the top 25 in rotisserie formats -- with double-digit power, albeit with a so-so batting average. However, his free-swinging nature leaves him susceptible to slumps, and he does have a troubling injury history at a young age. Mondesi's potential makes him well worth selection within the first 100 picks of your rotisserie draft, but he's not someone to reach for -- and in points-based leagues, he's someone better left to the late rounds because of his questionable approach at the plate."

No player in baseball history has seen a greater percentage of his plate appearances end in a home run, walk or strikeout than Gallo (59%). But while he's an all-or-nothing type, his flaws aren't nearly as damaging as many of the models who have come before him. While Gallo's 2019 season ended July 23 due to a broken hamate bone, until that point he had boosted his line-drive rate to 25% and posted top-six Statcast numbers with his 93.0 mph average exit velocity, 52.3% hard-contact rate and 11.4% barrel rate per trip to the plate, things that make him the most truly threatening power source in all of baseball. When healthy, Gallo stakes a legitimate claim to a 50-homer, 100-walk, albeit 200-strikeout, ceiling season, and his improving metrics make him less of a drain on your batting average than once feared. Check back on him during spring training to ensure no lingering injury effects, but if he's in the clear, he's a potential points-league monster (top 25-capable) who should also find himself in the season-ending Player Rater top 50."
Kyle Schwarber,OF,Cubs,529.0,82.0,38.0,92.0,70.0,156.0,2.0,0.25,0.33899999999999997,0.531,0.871,187.0,29.0,13.0,31.0,28.0,59.0,0.0,0.257,0.35600000000000004,0.524,0.88,"The arrow was pointing up for Schwarber as 2019 concluded, and as he enters his age-27 season, he might be primed for his best season yet. Last season, for the first time, he handled left-handed pitching adequately, hitting .229/.306/.450 against southpaws, with his continued improvement against them culminating in a .280/.366/.631 slash line and 20 home runs in 70 second-half games. The Cubs saw this and granted him career highs with 155 games and 610 plate appearances, with those rising numbers making him a much stronger selection than previously in weekly formats. Schwarber is now a locked-in top-100 asset in points-based leagues, and he has a realistic chance at reaching that tier in rotisserie leagues, too, especially with the new designated hitter role giving him a soft landing spot in the Cubs' everyday lineup."

Realmuto,C,Phillies,538.0,92.0,25.0,83.0,41.0,123.0,9.0,0.275,0.32799999999999996,0.493,0.82,183.0,32.0,9.0,30.0,14.0,40.0,2.0,0.27899999999999997,0.33299999999999996,0.514,0.847,"If you're a believer in a player requiring some time to adapt to new surroundings, surely you'll be tantalized by the second half of Realmuto's first Phillies season: .278/.327/.565 rates, 15 home runs, 41 RBIs, 5-for-5 on stolen bases and 37 runs scored in 60 games (out of the team's 71). His full season was scattered with positives, including personal bests in runs (92), doubles (36), homers (25), RBIs (83), total bases (265) and walks (41). Realmuto was tops at his position on the Player Rater and finished four points shy of the positional lead in the latter format, supporting his case to be the unanimous No. 1 catcher off any draft board again in 2020. He brings a rare five-category combination for a backstop, as well as the durability points-league managers desire. The main question is whether it's worth paying a premium to net the best overall catcher. It's probably worth it after the first 50 picks or so in a two-catcher league but closer to 75th in ESPN's one-catcher standard format."
Carlos Correa,SS,Astros,280.0,42.0,21.0,59.0,35.0,75.0,1.0,0.27899999999999997,0.358,0.568,0.9259999999999999,181.0,28.0,10.0,34.0,22.0,47.0,1.0,0.271,0.348,0.503,0.851,"As Correa enters his age-25 season, his plate appearance totals have shown an alarming pattern, going from 660 to 481 to 468 to a career-worst 321 in 2019, the latter the product of a fractured rib and back discomfort that cost him a combined 86 days' action. The back issues are especially disturbing, since they also plagued him in 2018 and have at times cut into his power output. Correa did hit eight home runs while slugging .575 in 22 games between injured list stints, showing that his bat still has some thump, but he also batted .238 during that time as he seemed to trade some contact for power. A healthy, strong spring would go a long way toward restoring Correa's status as a clear top-10 fantasy shortstop, as right now treating him as that is more of a throwback to his overwhelming scouting reports than his recent results."
DJ LeMahieu,"2B, 1B, 3B",Yankees,602.0,109.0,26.0,102.0,46.0,90.0,5.0,0.327,0.375,0.518,0.893,194.0,32.0,7.0,27.0,15.0,30.0,1.0,0.299,0.349,0.46399999999999997,0.813,"Departing Coors Field turned out to be not as damning for LeMahieu's fantasy value as expected, and in fact, he was often hailed as a top contender for MVP until deep in the 2019 season. Some of that was the sudden power boost; he hit a career-high 26 homers, in a season when everyone was doing so, inflated by a 13th-ranked 17.0% home run/fly ball percentage, with 19 of those coming at Yankee Stadium. Expected regression explains how he's more of a borderline top-100 fantasy asset entering 2020 than a repeat candidate, though he's one of the stronger return-on-investment players among that group, thanks to his being locked in as the Yankees' everyday second baseman and leadoff hitter this time around. He's also every bit as attractive a pick in points leagues as roto, so draft him with confidence, even if he sees his homers revert to 2018's 15."
Jorge Soler,"OF, DH",Royals,589.0,95.0,48.0,117.0,73.0,178.0,3.0,0.265,0.354,0.569,0.922,197.0,28.0,13.0,33.0,24.0,61.0,1.0,0.254,0.342,0.508,0.85,"Last season was the ""perfect storm"" for Soler. The rebuilding Royals had an open DH spot for the defensively challenged former Cub, and they didn't care about his proclivity for striking out. The rest was up to him -- and Soler came through, lofting the ball more than he had in 2018 and hitting it harder than at any time in his career. Not only did Soler revert to a 41% fly ball rate, but he lowered his infield pops by 5 percentage points -- a significant amount for someone with a 26% K rate. After all, an infield fly, like a whiff, is a guaranteed unproductive out. Soler played 56 games in the outfield last season, but could be hard-pressed to get the minimum required to avoid DH-only eligibility in future seasons. Even so, in today's homer-happy landscape, Soler has finally broken through and looks to be a quality source of power for the next few years."

His 29 extra-base hits from his July 29 debut forward ranked among the majors' top 15, and his 112 total bases ranked among the top 30. In fact, he became the first player in the modern era to double in nine consecutive games, something that should particularly appeal to those of you in points-based leagues. Bichette contributes solid totals in all five rotisserie categories, and considering he hit for more contact and stole more bases in the minors than he showed in Toronto, it's possible he'll take the next step forward and become a locked-in top-10 shortstop in 2020. He's a great dynasty building block and has the requisite upside to warrant a pick within the top 100, even in redraft formats."

As he has entered his prime, he has also incrementally improved his contact rate while showing the same level of elite plate discipline he has had throughout his big league career, hinting that the best might be yet to come. Conforto should again serve a middle-of-the-lineup slugger for the Mets, a top-25 fantasy outfielder in rotisserie leagues who could be nearly a top-50 overall asset in points leagues."

The added loft and reduced average exit velocity not only curtailed Hoskins' home run production, but his hit rate on fly balls staying in the yard is now just 11%. Factor in that Citizens Bank Park increases foul outs by 64% (Hoskins had 20 last season), and a career-low .226 batting average makes sense. As such, Hoskins is one of the rare hitters who should be trying to reduce his average launch angle. Despite declining average and waning power, Hoskins has maintained an exceptional walk rate and thus remains an asset in points leagues and OBP formats. He's less appealing in batting-average leagues, but there's upside in the event he reverts to 2017's swing mechanics."

The No. 73 player selected overall in ESPN leagues in the preseason, Guerrero finished only 325th on the Player Rater, though his contact-oriented swing and extra-base ability helped him earn the 203rd spot in terms of fantasy points, a format that seems to favor his skill set. Knee issues seemed to hamper his power potential, and he struggled mightily in the field, things that'll need to improve if he's to reach his future-MVP ceiling. Guerrero did spend this past winter working on his conditioning, a promising sign for a player who has sometimes drawn criticism for a lack of it, and he'll be one to watch for indicators of improvement during spring training. He remains one of the most attractive dynasty-league building blocks and has enough raw talent to warrant selection amongst the top 100 in any redraft format."
Max Muncy,"2B, 1B, 3B",Dodgers,487.0,101.0,35.0,99.0,90.0,149.0,4.0,0.253,0.375,0.517,0.893,170.0,36.0,11.0,34.0,32.0,51.0,1.0,0.259,0.38,0.512,0.892,"It was always difficult to imagine the Dodgers moving Muncy to a reserve role, taking a 134 wRC+ bat out of the lineup on a regular basis. That remote possibility is now a highly unlikely proposition after Muncy signed a three-year, $24.5 million extension in February. He should see the bulk of his action at first base with Gavin Lux earmarked for second. Muncy fell back some from 2018, but that was inevitable. Still, under the hood, Muncy's supporting stats were similar to 2018, so he's established a high floor, albeit with a tempered batting average due to below-average contact. Power is his game as Muncy's high average exit velocity on fly balls and a penchant for lofting contact work in concert. Points- and OBP-league participants take note, as Muncy's high walk rate is ideal for those formats."
Shohei Ohtani,"DH, SP",Angels,384.0,51.0,18.0,62.0,33.0,110.0,12.0,0.28600000000000003,0.34299999999999997,0.505,0.848,11.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.182,0.25,0.182,0.43200000000000005,"Ohtani will be nearly 22 months removed from Tommy John surgery at the time of 2020 Opening Day, so there's a good chance we'll see him on the mound a significant amount this season. He has already flashed elite ability on both sides of the ball, going 5-for-9 in quality starts with a 3.10 ERA and 30.5% strikeout rate before injuries began to surface in 2018, and hitting .287/.357/.596 with 15 home runs in 59 games as a near-regular designated hitter during the second half of 2019. In leagues with daily lineup locks, the ability to maximize his contributions as either hitter or pitcher, depending upon his daily role, boosts his value ahead of weekly leagues, where he'll be locked into one role or another for the entire scoring period. He's capable of a top-100 contribution overall in any format, even if he's limited to only one role or the other, but the case can be made he's a top-50 talent in our game thanks to the daily format."

Donaldson joins a very potent Twins lineup and will not have the pressure of coming in and carrying a huge load as many free agents often do. Donaldson simply makes an already-strong lineup even better and will be well-insulated hitting between Nelson Cruz and Eddie Rosario, assuming Cruz is fully recovered from his wrist injury. Otherwise, Donaldson moves up a spot in the order. Donaldson has just once driven in more than 100 runs in a full season, but that should not be a problem this season in Minnesota. A run at MVP-caliber numbers could be in store for him in 2020. This was the perfect landing spot for his 2020 fantasy futures."

While he's most highly regarded for his defense, his metrics weren't eye-popping, and while he did fill five rotisserie categories, they came with a disappointing 5.6% walk rate that threatens his ability to repeat his .288 batting average. Injuries held Laureano back for parts of 2019, but his .358/.411/.679 September rates gave a strong recent impression, which is why he'll be a universally regarded top-100 overall fantasy pick entering 2020. Expect regular at-bats as the Athletics' center fielder, with another season of solid, if unspectacular, across-the-board numbers."

Still, while regression is inevitable for Moncada in the batting average category, he has room for growth. He went on a .353/.393/.583 tear in 35 season-concluding games after recovering from a hamstring injury, including showing more contact in September, and he was more efficient on the basepaths. Moncada is a better pick in rotisserie leagues than in points-based formats, where his somewhat free-swinging nature detracts from his value. He's nevertheless worth a pick in the first 10 rounds in the former and only a round or two later in the latter."
Andrew Benintendi,OF,Red Sox,540.0,72.0,13.0,68.0,59.0,139.0,10.0,0.267,0.344,0.431,0.775,206.0,29.0,6.0,27.0,25.0,50.0,4.0,0.267,0.349,0.43700000000000006,0.7859999999999999,"Many fantasy managers expected a breakthrough from Benintendi in 2019; what they received was a season that barely cracked the top 200 overall in rotisserie and fell just shy of the top 300 in points-based formats. A professional-worst 22.8% strikeout rate had a lot to do with it, and he seemed to struggle to get any sort of elevation on the ball at all in his final 30 games, batting .175/.268/.268. Fortunately, Benintendi is still 25 years old with plenty of time to turn his career around, and that he continued to show no discernible platoon split -- he actually had a wOBA 15 points better against lefties than righties -- was promising. He can still fill five rotisserie categories and has a good enough historical reputation for contact to be equally attractive in points leagues, but it'd help if he had a solid spring before we invest at anything more than the price of a top-25 outfielder."
Mike Moustakas,"3B, 2B",Reds,523.0,80.0,35.0,87.0,53.0,98.0,3.0,0.254,0.32899999999999996,0.516,0.845,190.0,27.0,12.0,32.0,17.0,36.0,1.0,0.258,0.324,0.505,0.8290000000000001,"Moustakas finally got the multiyear deal he deserved in each of the prior two offseasons. He is coming off a three-year cycle of consistent production while playing for both Kansas City and Milwaukee. He added more loft to the baseball in recent seasons, and the results have paid off for his run-production totals. ""Moose"" had issues earlier in his career with lefties but has done better against them in recent seasons and had his best season yet against southpaws last year. In fact, he was more effective against them than he was righties in 2019. He carries the added bonus of being eligible at second base and third base on draft day, and the move to Cincinnati's ballpark keeps him in a friendly environment for his hitting style. Expect more of the same from Moustakas in 2020."

His 2019 performance caught some off guard. A strong batting average wasn't at all that surprising, but the power spike was an eye-opener. A significant uptick in hard-hit rate and average exit velocity without sacrificing much contact did the trick. McNeil hit fewer fly balls, which hindered the jump, though the extra grounders aided his average. That's a tradeoff he'll take, even in this power-hungry environment. McNeil's average fly ball distance was short relative to other 20-plus-HR hitters. Add in the chance that the 2020 ball doesn't travel as far and McNeil is a strong candidate to give back much of his power gain. However, his high contact rate offers a bankable floor. His multipositional eligibility doesn't hurt, either."

He is not a good defender, and that played a significant part in the Padres trading him to an American League team at the deadline. With the Indians, Reyes' strikeout rate jumped to 32.5% and his rate-power numbers declined, but he was still 9% better than the average MLB hitter in terms of wRC+ when all was said and done. He provided one of the first ""best shape of his life"" stories in 2020, reportedly shaving 18 pounds over the offseason, and there's some talk that he could play more outfield than originally expected. That's good news for his 2021 positional eligibility in fantasy leagues, but he's still likely a DH long term. He projects to hit fifth in Cleveland's batting order this season."
Gary Sanchez,C,Yankees,396.0,62.0,34.0,77.0,40.0,125.0,0.0,0.23199999999999998,0.316,0.525,0.841,150.0,24.0,12.0,29.0,15.0,47.0,0.0,0.24,0.32,0.513,0.833,"Here's how great Sanchez's power was in 2019. He matched his professional best with 34 home runs, yet he did so in 92 fewer trips to the plate. Unfortunately, injuries have become a persistent problem for him, as he has now made five separate trips to the IL in the past three seasons alone -- for biceps, groin (three times) and calf issues. If you're feeling lucky, Sanchez could stay on the field long enough to easily lap the catcher category in home runs, and one would presume from his past history of better contact rates that he'd improve enough there to raise his batting average from last year's .232. He's well worth the early pick because of the dearth of quality catchers, but don't get so carried away with your expectations that he's one of your first few players off the board."

However, he took an odd pathway to get there. As is the case with most batters, Brantley's home splits were better than on the road. However, his road splits were a career best, while his home performance was down a bit. If he doesn't improve on his home numbers and reverts to historical road levels, Brantley's average could dip. This is especially important since he is a compiler, relying on volume and a high average to bully up runs and RBIs. Additionally, age and injuries have sapped Brantley of his double-digits steals expectation. His floor is still one of the highest in the league, but reaching for Brantley in fantasy to stabilize batting average could be detrimental. Good thing he often comes at a ""boring, aging guy"" discount."

That decision made him one of the safest rookie investments in years, locking in his playing-time prospects in a way we rarely see in this era of service-time manipulation. Robert will need it. He's a free swinger who might need time to adapt to the game's most competitive level, having posted combined 5.1% walk and 74.5% contact rates between Double- and Triple-A. Still, he's a potential five-category fantasy standout, having hit .328/.376/.624 with 32 HRs and 36 stolen bases across three minor league levels in 2019. Expect inconsistency from him initially, but he's well worth selecting as a Nos. 4-5 mixed-league OF in redraft leagues and as a building block in dynasty formats."

They don't hit the ball -- they punish it! They also fan a ton, the latter two in particular. The key with Sano is health and conditioning. Looking at his 2019 campaign, there are reasons for optimism. He had surgery for a mysterious lacerated ankle, finally taking the field in mid-May. While he missed time now and again, Sano avoided another visit to the IL. The move across the diamond to a less physically demanding 1B position should benefit him. While Sano's career 36% K-rate might be a detriment in standard rotisserie leagues, a 12% career BB rate mitigates the damage in OBP leagues, as well as in points formats lacking an excessive penalty for strikeouts. Power can be found later in drafts, but not with the level of runs and RBIs that Sano can also provide."

Skills-wise, his 78.7% contact rate represented a professional best and he began to show a bit more lift on the ball, but he also benefited from an unsustainable .399 BABIP while walking a miserable 2.9% of the time. These rates threaten to regress and may result in as much as a 75-point drop in his 2020 batting average. Anderson isn't actually the top-50 rotisserie performer he appeared to be, but he contributes enough in the five prominent categories to warrant a midround/top-12-SS pick there. The problem is in points leagues where he's significantly less valuable because of his poor plate discipline."

It's like there were tons of players who hit 36 homers last season after previously managing no more than 20. The outfielder's .252/.336/.519 slash line represented career bests in all three categories, while his 98 runs and 90 RBI were also easily career highs. Statcast generally supported his breakout, as it was driven by more career-bests in barrel rate, exit velocity, launch angle and hard-hit rate, even if his .458 xSLG suggests he overachieved by a fair amount. He has room to regress and still be a productive bat."

While he displayed a good share of contact as he raised his launch angle to a career-high 14.1 degrees, he also saw a dip in hard contact, had a 59 point wOBA platoon split and missed time with a hamstring injury. Fortunately, Seager's strong finish offers some hope of his taking the next step in 2020, as he hit .288/.317/.588 with 10 home runs and 40 RBIs in his final 40 games. He'll enter the year as the Dodgers' starting shortstop, and isn't far off a top-10 valuation in fantasy at his position."

The 2013 second-round draft pick of the Cardinals registered a fine rookie season, finishing with 15 homers and the same number of steals. Long term, Mercado projects more as a stolen-base threat than a home run guy, sporting 97th percentile sprint speed. Mercado's average fly ball distance is relatively short, but most of his homers are down the line. With only one year under his belt, it's unclear if this pull nature will continue, allowing Mercado to perennially threaten double-digit homers. Truth be told, he'd be better off with the Willie Mays Hayes approach, keeping the ball on the ground while regaining the plate discipline displayed in the minors. Draft Mercado for steals and consider home runs a bonus."

On the other, it was still only 100 games and 413 plate appearances. He reinforced previous buzz with an .877 OPS. The thing is, while everyone benefits from Coors Field, Statcast data suggests Dahl is helped more than most: His average exit velocity and launch angle wouldn't typically translate into his production. This is corroborated by home/away splits, as he had a .412 wOBA at home compared to just .308 on the road. Over the years, Dahl has missed action from rib, back, hamstring and abdominal issues, as well as a stomach virus, a broken foot and a sprained ankle costing him the final two months of the 2019 campaign. The best use of Dahl is to stream his home at-bats in leagues with ample reserves. Save an IL spot for him."

That's the good news. However, he has also made six IL trips and missed 120 Twins games during the same amount of time, due to migraines, toe, wrist, concussion and shoulder (twice) issues. That's less appealing. Buxton is as injury-prone as they come, and while his top-shelf speed and defense coupled with a hint of pop has value, it's difficult to ignore his fragility as he enters his age-26 season with a decreasing long-term ceiling. He's a No. 4-5 OF in mixed rotisserie leagues, and one with whom to brace for headaches. He might not be worth the chance at all in points-based leagues, where his free-swinging ways are an additional problem."

The expected stats suggested that Escobar overachieved in 2018, which left many skeptical of what he would do in 2019. He silenced his critics and then some with a career season, but the expected stats once again suggest pessimism of a repeat, indicating that Escobar overachieved in batting average and slugging percentage. Back-to-back seasons of 600-plus plate appearances is nice, and he has made the most of the playing time to compile some solid-to-awesome production. The running game is the only area where he is not helping you, but he provides enough run production that you'll forgive him for not running. There is nothing special in his indicators, but it's tough to argue with his work the past two seasons."

""Spanky"" has long had the on-base chops, but he missed significant time in 2017 and 2018 with major injuries. Last season was the perfect storm, as he had the most playing time in four seasons, hit first or second in a potent lineup nearly all season and set career highs in home runs and runs scored. We saw him do this in back-to-back seasons with the White Sox in 2015 and 2016, so 2019 looks more like him reestablishing his abilities rather than a new level of performance. The key now is for him to avoid a major injury and put together two seasons of health. The RBIs may never be there, but the rest of the production is solid."

Well, that's what the Blue Jays hope anyway after the 26-year-old Cuban blasted 20 homers in what amounts to a little over half a season of full-time play last year. An April trip to Triple-A along with wrist, knee and quad woes cut into Gurriel's playing time before he missed the last week of the season due to an appendectomy. Gurriel's power blossomed after he increased his average launch angle by four degrees, taking better advantage of his 71st-percentile average exit velocity. While the future looks bright for the younger of the Gurriels, durability and the chance he might give back some of his skills gains are both concerns. Risk notwithstanding, hitting in the upper portion of an improving lineup is inviting."

That's the product of his elite walk rate and a perfect 14-for-14 performance stealing bases for the Blue Jays last season, greatly increasing his chances for more green lights. He struck out a lot -- 28.6% of plate appearances -- and had a 20.1 degree launch angle that was sixth highest in the majors, so batting average might become a real problem as he fully adapts to the big leagues. There's a lot to like in Biggio's game, but for now he's more of a high-upside, borderline top-10 option among second basemen than something greater."
Carlos Santana,"1B, DH",Indians,573.0,110.0,34.0,93.0,108.0,108.0,4.0,0.281,0.397,0.515,0.9109999999999999,196.0,33.0,10.0,29.0,37.0,35.0,1.0,0.26,0.379,0.48,0.858,"It was quite the homecoming for Santana in Cleveland, as he tied a career high with 34 homers while setting career highs in both RBIs and runs scored. The 110 runs was a shocker that overshot every projection -- we just do not see that type of runs total from a player who spends his time hitting third or fourth in the batting order. Santana, Freddie Freeman and Anthony Rendon were the only players to score at least 110 runs while hitting third or fourth last season, while Jose Ramirez and Miguel Cabrera are the only other players in the past decade to do so. Santana's full-season career-best .397 OBP gave him plenty of run-scoring opportunities in a talented lineup. The conditions are there for him to have another huge season, but look for some of those runs to move to the RBI category."

Then, a hand injury resulting from his being hit by a pitch on June 27 cost him an additional three games, after which point he slashed just .189/.273/.304 with a 27.7% strikeout rate in 65 games. Before those ailments, especially in the season's first three weeks when he batted .270/.316/.689 in 19 games, Davis seemed to be the same slugger he had been in the three prior seasons. As such, it's not outrageous to expect a rebound should he report to spring training fully rested and healed. That version is a top-50-overall fantasy performer across all formats, even as a DH-only player. Keep close tabs on his progress during spring training. Since the prospect of further injuries will (and should) deflate his draft stock into the middle rounds, he might be quite the profit center."

While that will be a battle, his blue-chip prospect status might earn him an edge, assuming the Dodgers don't want to keep his service time in check. Make no mistake, Lux can rake. He's the kind of player with easy top-10 potential at second base if he's in an everyday role, but his base stealing comes with some questions, as he was only 52-for-77 during his minor league career. He's a top dynasty/keeper-league prospect, and one who could settle in the top 100 in redraft leagues if he's looking good during spring training."
Kyle Tucker,OF,Astros,67.0,15.0,4.0,11.0,4.0,20.0,5.0,0.26899999999999996,0.319,0.537,0.857,156.0,22.0,8.0,24.0,13.0,46.0,5.0,0.237,0.301,0.455,0.7559999999999999,"One of only four players in 2019 to have a 30/30 season between the majors and minors combined, Tucker enters spring training in the mix for a starting OF spot with the Astros. To make the team -- and to ultimately succeed once he does -- he'll need to cut down on the strikeouts (20 in 67 big league at-bats) and show greater patience, lest he become a streaky performer, especially in batting average. Tucker's minor league track record and his 23 years of age provide him plenty of room for growth, and his 76-of-95 SB success rate over the past three seasons elevates his floor in that category. If his spring progresses well, he'd be worth a top-30 fantasy OF draft selection in all formats, but even if it appears he's minor league-bound initially, he's worth a late-round stash. Be forewarned, however, that continued swing-and-misses would extend his downside in points leagues."
Yuli Gurriel,"1B, 3B",Astros,564.0,85.0,31.0,104.0,37.0,65.0,5.0,0.29600000000000004,0.342,0.539,0.8809999999999999,192.0,26.0,8.0,31.0,10.0,23.0,1.0,0.276,0.316,0.479,0.795,"Gurriel was one of the many players who took to the new baseball nicely, hitting as many homers in 2019 as he had the previous two seasons combined. Gurriel added more loft last year, hitting more flyballs than groundballs for the first time in his career. Nineteen of his 31 homers came at home, and his batting average at Minute Maid Park was 24 points higher than it was on the road. Before you read too far into that, know that was the reverse of the previous two seasons, when he hit for a higher average on the road. Gurriel is at his best with runners on base; he has a career .739 OPS with the bases empty, an .888 OPS with anyone on base and a .962 OPS with runners in scoring position. The Houston lineup presents many opportunities for him to continue that trend."

That's saying something considering he comes with defensive questions and is only 50-for-74 attempting steals in his big-league career. At 24, he's still young enough to continue to improve, but it's unclear whether his total package includes ceilings greater than a .290 batting average, 20 home runs or 20 stolen bases. His categorical balance makes him an upside play from amongst the middle-infield tier in rotisserie formats, but he's a more dangerous selection in points leagues due to his free-swinging nature."

He also failed to play more than 135 games for the third consecutive season, as he has not been able to avoid the injured list. When he is on the field, the production has been very consistent, even if his strikeout rate has worsened year over year in that time. His 16% strikeout rate in 2019 was still much better than league average, but that rate was 10% two seasons ago. Now in his mid-30s, Turner faces the possibility of his bat beginning to slow down in addition to the health questions. His production could dip if the quality of contact starts the slide in 2020 that his contact rate has seen the past few years."

He will hit in the middle of a potent lineup, insulated by Jose Abreu and either Edwin Encarnacion or Eloy Jimenez. Grandal should be able to use his plate-discipline skills and the home park to his advantage and challenge the 30-homer plateau again while setting career highs in both runs and runs driven in. He has been an above-average run producer in each of the past four seasons while getting nearly all of his playing time at catcher due to his framing skills. That will likely continue unless Abreu needs to cover the DH role due to an Encarnacion injury. He should be an outstanding contributor at catcher for the run-production categories while hitting for just enough average."
Edwin Encarnacion,"1B, DH",White Sox,418.0,81.0,34.0,86.0,58.0,103.0,0.0,0.244,0.344,0.531,0.875,168.0,29.0,12.0,34.0,24.0,44.0,0.0,0.23800000000000002,0.337,0.494,0.831,"One of these years, Encarnacion is going to show his age and see his statistical production fall off. He has hit 30 or more homers in eight consecutive seasons and moves to a ballpark that has favorable conditions for him to make it a ninth consecutive season. He has missed time in each of the past two seasons with arm injuries but has still managed to put up his numbers while playing in strong lineups. The move to the south side of Chicago presents him with another potent lineup in which to drive in runs. The Statcast data shows that his outcomes profile continues to stay one step ahead of his age, so we should get another year of 30 homers -- or 10-12, when prorated to 60 games -- from him. His health will determine what else he brings to the table in 2020."

While that capped his counting-stat production, it helped Pederson reach a new level with his ratios and rate stats. He went from being league average by wRC+ in 2017 to 26-27% better than league average the past two seasons, while setting new career highs in BA in back-to-back years. After posting K-rates in the high-20s in his first three years in the league, Pederson sat around 20% in recent seasons. The soon-to-be 28-year-old has gained dual eligibility, having played 20 games at first base in addition to 122 in his customary outfield spot. A February trade to the Angels fell through and the Dodgers are saying Pederson will be part of the team in 2020 after all, so don't expect an increase in playing time. For fantasy players, Pederson is better off in a platoon role anyway."

The Rangers led MLB in pilfers under first-year skipper Chris Woodward, and with Texas moving to a less hitter-friendly ballpark, Andrus should continue to get the green light. That said, the 31-year-old's sprint speed is just 46th percentile, so counting on a full repeat is risky. In addition, despite a rebound in batting average, Andrus' on-base skills are in question after he posted the lowest walk rate of his career last season. In Andrus' favor is volume. He's played at least 145 games in 10 of his 11 seasons. A consistently high contact rate gives Andrus a stable batting-average floor, and he has the ability to compile double-digit homers. Just be skeptical of another 30-steal campaign."
Bryan Reynolds,OF,Pirates,491.0,83.0,16.0,68.0,46.0,121.0,3.0,0.316,0.379,0.505,0.884,195.0,33.0,6.0,28.0,20.0,48.0,1.0,0.287,0.35600000000000004,0.467,0.823,"It wasn't long ago that a rookie producing .314/.377/.503 in 134 games (like Reynolds did in 2019) would make him a unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year hardware. Amazingly, he finished a distant fourth in the NL voting. After posting a 1.181 OPS to open the season with Triple-A Albuquerque, Reynolds was summoned by the Pirates as an injury fill-in and ended up staying in the Steel City all year. While Reynolds' Statcast metrics suggest he will avoid a dramatic sophomore slump, regression is likely, as he outperformed both his expected batting average and slugging percentage. A 67th-percentile hard-hit rate and 76th-percentile sprint speed support an above-average BABIP, leaving a solid floor. Reynolds hit second in the order for most of last season, but he could drop down with a return to health of some teammates. That said, Reynolds should still hit high enough in the lineup to be productive, providing batting average support to fantasy teams."
Scott Kingery,"OF, 3B",Phillies,458.0,64.0,19.0,55.0,34.0,147.0,15.0,0.258,0.315,0.474,0.7879999999999999,171.0,23.0,6.0,18.0,11.0,49.0,4.0,0.24600000000000002,0.297,0.433,0.73,"Blocked at every field position entering last spring after a disappointing 2018 rookie campaign, Kingery emerged as a super-utility player, his hot start with the bat ultimately earning him 109 starts in the Phillies' final 117 games across five positions. He'll presumably settle in at third base to begin 2020, but he also carries outfield eligibility and could factor into the second-base or shortstop mixes if injuries dictate. Kingery's free-swinging ways are a tad more problematic in points-based leagues, but his 15-for-19 SB rate in 2019, his fly ball leanings and an over-8% rise in hard-contact rate all make him an attractive late-round pick in mixed rotisserie leagues."
Lorenzo Cain,OF,Brewers,562.0,75.0,11.0,48.0,50.0,106.0,18.0,0.262,0.326,0.374,0.7,193.0,27.0,4.0,16.0,20.0,36.0,6.0,0.285,0.35600000000000004,0.39899999999999997,0.755,"Cain saw action in 148 games last season, but his numbers at the plate and on the basepaths took a major dip. After one of the best hitting seasons of his career in 2018, Cain had his worst OPS since 2013 and stole 12 fewer bases than he did the season before. That could be cause for concern for a player turning 34 years old, but Cain dealt with injuries nearly the entire way and did not have luck on his side, finishing with a career-low .301 BABIP. Cain is still among the best in center field and won his first Gold Glove in 2019, so he will still see the field plenty. His aggressive defense exposes him to injury more than some, but if he can avoid missing too many games -- and also a few more defenders when he puts the bat on the ball -- he would be in position to bounce back."

He made the absolute most out of his playing time, hitting at or near the top of a loaded Minnesota lineup that will only be stronger in 2020. The increase in power came from a change in his approach, as he got more loft to the baseball, increasing his fly ball rate by six percentage points. The one thing holding the switch-hitter back is that he is much more effective from the right side than the left. He did have ankle surgery in late November to relieve an impingement issue, which put a pause on baseball activities until early January. It will be interesting to see how the change in offseason planning affects him in the new year, if at all."
Brian Anderson,"3B, OF",Marlins,459.0,57.0,20.0,66.0,44.0,114.0,5.0,0.261,0.342,0.46799999999999997,0.8109999999999999,183.0,26.0,5.0,25.0,18.0,47.0,1.0,0.257,0.33799999999999997,0.41,0.748,"The standards to qualify as a �bright spot� with the Marlins have been quite low in recent seasons, but Anderson would cross that bar anywhere. He backed up his 112 wRC+ from the 2018 season with a 114 mark last season, the product of a .261/.342/.468 slash line. He also saw his HR total jump from 11 to 20. Those numbers don't exactly leap off the page, but when combined with strong defensive metrics both at third base and in right field, it's enough to make him a solidly above-average starter. While he's developed into arguably the Marlins' best player, his skill set still doesn't add up to a particularly intriguing fantasy asset given his mediocre contact and power. There's certainly value in a 26-year-old with a decent bat who is eligible at two positions, but he's held back by his tough home park and poor supporting cast."
Paul DeJong,SS,Cardinals,583.0,97.0,30.0,78.0,62.0,149.0,9.0,0.23199999999999998,0.316,0.44299999999999995,0.759,197.0,31.0,10.0,28.0,19.0,52.0,1.0,0.244,0.32,0.452,0.772,"DeJong possesses an interesting batted-ball profile. He's a fly ball hitter, which obviously benefits home runs. However, his average exit velocity is just 20th percentile, which is seemingly out of whack with hitting 30 homers, especially with power-suppressing Busch Stadium as his home. DeJong's component data is telling. His average exit velocity on fly balls is 4 mph faster than average, while he hits grounders weaker than most. This generated the 43rd-longest average fly ball distance -- well over 90th percentile -- which helped support his HR production. This not only explains the power, but also DeJong's low BABIP, as weak grounders usually result in outs. While there's no guarantee DeJong maintains that elevated fly ball exit velocity, it comes from his uppercut swing. Therefore, it's probable he continues to hit for power with a low average."

To be fair, any amount of time Upton misses can be classified as significant given that he had previously avoided the injured list through nine MLB seasons. Durability is a skill until it is not any longer, and Upton's body betrayed him in 2019. You almost want to throw away his entire stat line because the production was so far off from what he produced from 2016 to 2018 that it's unfair to believe this is the new norm for him. The running game is likely a thing of the past, but if he can stay healthy and return to his pre-injury levels, he stands to benefit from a strong lineup in front of him."

After hitting a respectable but not particularly noteworthy .268/.335/.414 in 335 plate appearances in 2018, he managed an excellent .273/.365/.630 line last season while seeing his home run total jump from seven to 31 in just 24 more plate appearances. Only six catchers all-time have slugged at least that high in at least as many trips to the plate. Did Garver suddenly become an all-time great overnight? Probably not, but Statcast gives plenty of reason to buy the breakout, giving him an xSLG of .573 and a hard-hit rate of 50.0%. Part of Garver's success might have been the fact that he was able to stay fresh with a relatively light workload. The departure of fellow backstop Jason Castro could lead to more at-bats, but more wear-and-tear."

The 30-year-old right-handed hitter is coming off his best season, according to Statcast metrics, though his 2018 fantasy numbers were better. Specifically, Cron set personal bests in average exit velocity, Barrel% and hard-hit rate, along with an improved 21.6 K% -- his lowest mark since 2016. On paper, Cron should benefit from the change in home venue, as Comerica Park boosts right-handed power while Target Field suppresses it. As a team, Detroit's offense will be below average, but there's ample firepower at the top for Cron to hold his own in runs and RBIs, and he's likely to eclipse his previous high of 140 games played. Corner infield isn't as deep as usual, making Cron one of the better late-round options."

The trade of Paul Goldschmidt and a couple of injuries paved the way for Walker to play regularly at first base in the desert. He came through, posting an 85th percentile average exit velocity and 94th percentile hard-hit rate while dropping his strikeout rate to a career-low 25.7%. Walker also significantly lowered his chase rate while becoming more discerning in the zone, resulting in a career-best 11.1% walk rate. Assuming the Diamondbacks don't sign another solid bat, Walker should at least match last season's playing time, though if he slumps, Jake Lamb could snag some at-bats. First base isn't as deep as past seasons, rendering Walker a sneaky option for those who decide to wait after missing out on the top few tiers."
Willson Contreras,C,Cubs,360.0,57.0,24.0,64.0,38.0,102.0,1.0,0.272,0.355,0.5329999999999999,0.888,171.0,24.0,8.0,28.0,18.0,46.0,1.0,0.257,0.34,0.462,0.802,"Contreras has an odd batted-ball profile for a power-hitting backstop, stroking ground balls more than half the time while exhibiting prolific power when he lofts the ball. His average exit velocity distribution screams uppercut swing. To wit, Contreras' average exit velocity on fly balls and line drives is well above average with a below-average mark on grounders. This explains a home run-per-fly ball rate above 24% in three of the last four campaigns. If Contreras can convert some grounders into fly balls, he would have 30-homer upside. Contreras outperforms his expected batting due to the above-average exit velocity on lofted balls along with 71st percentile sprint speed resulting in twice as many infield hits as the average catcher. If your draft plan entails rostering a top catcher, Contreras should be on your short list."
Brandon Lowe,2B,Rays,296.0,42.0,17.0,51.0,25.0,113.0,5.0,0.27,0.336,0.514,0.85,177.0,25.0,9.0,30.0,17.0,61.0,2.0,0.249,0.32299999999999995,0.475,0.7979999999999999,"Lowe's batting profile is more like a corner infielder than a second baseman. He's a fly ball hitter with a high strikeout rate. Lowe hits the ball with ample authority to have plus power but playing in Tropicana Field is a detriment and the combo of low contact and fly ball outs caps Lowe's batting average. Last season, Lowe missed most of the second half with a quad injury, so an artificially high .377 BABIP didn't have a chance to regress. He has above-average speed, so the landing would probably have been soft, but he was hitting a bit over his skis. There are very few everyday players on the Rays, so expect the lefty swinger to occupy the strong side of a keystone platoon, with a chance to lose playing time if his excessive whiffs result in a slump."
Jean Segura,SS,Phillies,576.0,79.0,12.0,60.0,30.0,73.0,10.0,0.28,0.32299999999999995,0.42,0.743,208.0,30.0,4.0,21.0,11.0,26.0,4.0,0.28800000000000003,0.32899999999999996,0.413,0.742,"Looking to fortify the top of their order, the Phillies acquired Segura from the Mariners last offseason. Despite a short stint on the IL in April, Segura's return to the senior circuit went swimmingly, as he was slashing .360/.406/.551 through May 4. However, from that point on, Segura registered a .265/.307/.396 line, finishing with a .280 average, his first season below .300 since 2015. The good news is Segura's underlying metrics were nearly identical to recent seasons, specifically contact rate, average exit velocity and launch angle. A rebound is likely, but there still are a couple of concerns. After six straight seasons with at least 20 steals, Segura swiped only 10 bags. Plus, with Didi Gregorius in town, Segura could hit in the lower half of the order. Segura's slash line should rebound, albeit with less production than a couple of years ago, especially in the stolen-base category."
J.D. Davis,"OF, 3B",Mets,410.0,65.0,22.0,57.0,38.0,97.0,3.0,0.307,0.369,0.527,0.895,179.0,28.0,9.0,26.0,16.0,46.0,1.0,0.27899999999999997,0.34,0.486,0.826,"Entering 2019, there were legitimate questions about Davis' ability to hit at the major-league level after he registered a paltry .175 average in 103 at-bats in 2018. Davis emphatically silenced those doubts, posting a .307/.369/.527 slash line while clubbing 22 home runs in 410 at-bats. Statcast data provided legitimacy to his performance, as Davis registered an 11.4% barrel rate and 91.4 mph average exit velocity, both well above average. As it turns out, there is little to complain about when reviewing Davis' offensive output. He hit the ball hard (41.6 Hard%) while maintaining a palatable 21.4 K% and displaying adequate patience at the plate, logging a healthy 8.4% walk rate. Things didn't go nearly as smoothly defensively, but the Mets have little choice but to find a spot for Davis to play as long as he continues to wield a potent stick."
Aaron Hicks,OF,Yankees,221.0,41.0,12.0,36.0,31.0,72.0,1.0,0.235,0.325,0.44299999999999995,0.769,122.0,22.0,7.0,21.0,19.0,34.0,1.0,0.23800000000000002,0.34,0.451,0.7909999999999999,"Tommy John surgery performed on Hicks' elbow on Halloween was expected to sideline him for 8-10 months, for a July-August projected timetable, and he indicated he might be ready for full-time play by the time of the delayed Opening Day. His .250/.359/.464 rates and per-162-games averages of 31 home runs and 13 stolen bases from 2017-19 are attractive stats for when he eventually returns, but he has also missed nearly as many games (202) during that span as he has played (284), which casts doubt upon such a quick recovery or his ability to stay healthy regularly even after his return. Unless your team allows an expansive injured list, Hicks might be better left to the sidelines awaiting positive notes on his recovery."
Mallex Smith,OF,Mariners,510.0,70.0,6.0,37.0,42.0,141.0,46.0,0.22699999999999998,0.3,0.335,0.635,164.0,22.0,2.0,11.0,13.0,42.0,13.0,0.23800000000000002,0.306,0.341,0.647,"While Smith led the majors in stolen bases last season with 46, he was not a big net-positive in the rotisserie game, finishing with roughly $5 earned in 12-team mixed leagues. By real-world measures, Smith was essentially a replacement-level player. He legged out 19 infield hits, but still managed just a .227 average while fanning in about 25% of his plate appearances. Smith does not walk much and the power is pretty much nonexistent, as evidenced by his 13 career home runs in more than 1,600 major league plate appearances. Smith's average exit velocity, hard-hit rate, xBA, xSLG and xwOBA all ranked in the bottom 5% of the league, per Statcast. In pretty much every non-rotisserie format, Smith is undraftable. In roto leagues he's in the mix, but only as a desperation play if you miss out on speed early. Beware that the threat of reduced playing time is very real, even in Seattle."
Salvador Perez,C,Royals,,,,,,,,,,,,143.0,15.0,7.0,22.0,5.0,30.0,0.0,0.259,0.29600000000000004,0.455,0.7509999999999999,"Tommy John surgery cost Perez the entirety of 2019, and we haven't seen him play since September 2018. Still, coming into spring training, all signs were positive regarding his recovery. The Royals, who had made Perez one of the game's true workhorse catchers before his injury, might even give him time at first base, which should alleviate some of the concerns about physical wear and tear (not to mention add another position to his eligibility list). Perez's extreme fly ball shift in the three years before his surgery suggested he should be able to be one of the better power sources from the catcher-eligible pool. His free-swinging ways are a problem in points leagues, where he might have a tougher time finishing as a top-10 performer at the position. Monitor his health this spring, but there's every reason to believe that he will rebound."
Danny Santana,"OF, 1B",Rangers,474.0,81.0,28.0,81.0,25.0,151.0,21.0,0.28300000000000003,0.324,0.534,0.857,196.0,27.0,7.0,27.0,10.0,64.0,6.0,0.245,0.28600000000000003,0.418,0.7040000000000001,"Santana's 28 homers and .534 SLG seemingly came out of nowhere, but his average flyball distance in 2017 portended to twice as many homers (he hit four in 178 plate appearances) and his 2019 average distance easily backed the breakout. That said, with the likelihood he will play most of his home games with the roof closed in a new climate-controlled venue, some regression is likely. Still, Santana also does something few other first basemen can do -- steal bases. He was 21-for-27 (78 percent) last season, a good enough clip to keep earning the green light. Santana's plate skills are lacking (29.5% K% and 4.9% BB% last season), but a 90th-percentile average exit velocity means good things usually happen when he hits the ball. Santana is slated to be the Rangers regular center fielder, but in fantasy leagues he can help accrue steals from the first-base position."
Andrew McCutchen,OF,Phillies,219.0,45.0,10.0,29.0,43.0,55.0,2.0,0.256,0.37799999999999995,0.457,0.8340000000000001,181.0,32.0,9.0,25.0,28.0,45.0,2.0,0.26,0.363,0.47,0.833,"The Phillies signed McCutchen in an attempt to bolster their leadoff spot. Through his first 59 games, the veteran was getting on base at a 38% clip and was on pace for well over 100 runs. Unfortunately, his season was cut short when he tore the ACL in his left knee during a fluke rundown, instigated when Jean Segura failed to run out a popup with McCutchen on first base. Surgery was required to repair the damage, though McCutchen is expected to make a full recovery. The 34-year-old outfielder is again ticketed for the top spot in the Phillies' lineup, playing mostly left field and possibly some designated hitter. McCutchen displayed strong skills across the board, sporting 91st percentile sprint speed pre-injury. Even so, he was only 2-for-3 in steals during the truncated campaign. If healthy, his opportunities could increase with Joe Girardi now at the helm."
Eric Hosmer,1B,Padres,619.0,72.0,22.0,99.0,40.0,163.0,0.0,0.265,0.31,0.425,0.735,210.0,25.0,6.0,30.0,16.0,53.0,0.0,0.257,0.311,0.4,0.711,"From a real baseball sense, Hosmer is fighting an uphill battle, as he will always be judged relative to his exorbitant contact. In the fantasy realm, he's at a disadvantage since he doesn't provide the power many feel is a requisite for his position. The combination of these factors usually (and unfairly) penalizes Hosmer on draft day. On rosters looking to balance risk with stability, Hosmer provides the latter. Granted, much of his production is volume-driven, as he's averaged 159 games for the past five seasons. Still, Hosmer has averaged just 22 homers over that span, albeit it with a sneaky 84 runs and 92 RBIs. Last season, Hosmer knocked in 99 teammates. With an improved lineup, eclipsing the century mark in RBIs for the second time is plausible. Since he hardly runs anymore (0-for-3 last season in attempted steals), Hosmer has little to no upside. But like a solid hardwood floor, he offers durability and reliability."

He is still getting 600-plus plate appearances -- reaching that threshold in six of the past seven seasons -- but the batting average has decreased in each of the past four years while his ability to make contact is getting incrementally worse. Just two seasons ago, Votto struck out in only 12% of his plate appearances, but that number rose to 20% last year. We saw him post his lowest OBP of his career (.357) in 2019, and his walk rate also fell to its worst rate since 2008. Votto is still receiving a similar amount of pitches in the zone, but last year he expanded his zone like he did earlier in his career, and he was punished for it. There is little optimism for a late-career bounce-back."
Tommy Edman,"3B, 2B",Cardinals,326.0,59.0,11.0,36.0,16.0,61.0,15.0,0.304,0.35,0.5,0.85,204.0,32.0,5.0,20.0,12.0,37.0,7.0,0.27899999999999997,0.327,0.431,0.759,"Edman doesn't have a firm position entering 2020, but he also plays for a Cardinals team that likes to shuffle players around the field and has a thinner roster on the offensive side than at this time a year ago. Thanks to his contact-driven approach, he scored the 41st-most fantasy points of any player from July 1 forward, and while his .346 BABIP is likely to regress, he's capable enough with both the bat and his legs to contribute on the lower tiers of mixed leagues to weigh in all fantasy leagues. Edman begins 2020 both second- and third-base eligible and could add the outfield to his in-season qualification list, so keep him tucked away as a safety-net player in the late rounds."
Ryan McMahon,"2B, 3B",Rockies,480.0,70.0,24.0,83.0,56.0,160.0,5.0,0.25,0.32899999999999996,0.45,0.779,160.0,21.0,6.0,25.0,16.0,47.0,1.0,0.263,0.331,0.444,0.775,"McMahon forced his way into regular duty across three different positions for the Rockies last season, posting top-250 across-the-board fantasy production. In the process, he enjoyed almost identical righty/lefty splits (.331 and .326, respectively), though his Coors/road splits were wide and he hit the ball on the ground more than 50% of the time, tempering some enthusiasm. McMahon's major league-high 26.2% HR/FB rate after the All-Star break also suggested he could struggle to repeat his career-high 24 homers. As he should play a fair amount between first and second base again, he'll be a worthwhile middle infield option in mixed leagues, but it'll probably require an elevation of his launch angle for him to take the next step."
Luke Voit,"1B, DH",Yankees,429.0,72.0,21.0,62.0,71.0,142.0,0.0,0.263,0.37799999999999995,0.46399999999999997,0.8420000000000001,155.0,24.0,8.0,23.0,21.0,47.0,0.0,0.258,0.358,0.465,0.8220000000000001,"Expectations were high after Voit compiled a .333/.405/.689 line with the Yankees to end the 2018 campaign. He was trending toward a respectable follow-up season last summer, slashing .278/.392/.493 on July 30. Voit was then shelved with a sports hernia and wasn't the same when he came back, posting an anemic .200/.319/.338 line after returning on Aug. 30. Voit's opposite-field approach is ideal for Yankee Stadium as he's only pulled 13 of his 40 career homers. A high strikeout rate suggests his average should settle closer to 2019 than 2018, but a high walk rate helps soften the blow in OBP and points leagues. Voit enters the 2020 season healthy with the inside track on the starting job at first base. The Yankees have other options to cycle through but his on-base ability with plus power should keep him in the lineup nearly every day early on."
Wilson Ramos,C,Mets,473.0,52.0,14.0,73.0,44.0,69.0,1.0,0.28800000000000003,0.35100000000000003,0.41600000000000004,0.768,176.0,19.0,6.0,29.0,16.0,29.0,0.0,0.267,0.33,0.415,0.745,"Ramos has consistently hit the ball hard, averaging a 90 mph exit velocity since the stat has been measured. The problem is that his contact is coming with an alarming decrease in loft. Ramos' average launch angle in 2019 was nonexistent -- 0.0 -- as 62% of his batted balls were grounders. Ramos' most frequent batted-ball outcome was a pulled ground ball to the left side into a shift, but he hits the ball hard enough to get through shifts and has maintained a strong batting average for the catching position. The ground ball thing is not a fluke, as Ramos has a 55% career ground ball rate, but 2019 was the first time since 2012 that his ground balls outpaced his fly balls by a 3-to-1 margin. The Mets are moving him down in the lineup, and you should move him down in your rankings."
Shin-Soo Choo,"OF, DH",Rangers,563.0,93.0,24.0,61.0,78.0,165.0,15.0,0.265,0.371,0.455,0.826,178.0,23.0,6.0,17.0,23.0,54.0,3.0,0.242,0.34,0.38799999999999996,0.727,"Choo turns 38 during the 2020 season, but you would never know it based on his production in recent years. He has had at least 600 plate appearances in four of the past five seasons. He continues to hit with authority, while displaying outstanding on-base skills. He even surprised us with 15 steals last season after reaching double digits only once in the prior six seasons. Choo is a good reminder that stolen bases are not all about speed, as his average sprint speed was identical to those of Miguel Sano and Jose Abreu in 2019. His hitting prowess can be neutralized by left-handed pitchers, but he maximizes his production against righties with a near-.900 OPS over the past two seasons. The Rangers have a new stadium, which will likely alter the run environment, but this is very safe production to roster as Choo heads into free agency in 2021."
Didi Gregorius,SS,Phillies,324.0,47.0,16.0,61.0,17.0,53.0,2.0,0.24100000000000002,0.27899999999999997,0.444,0.7240000000000001,190.0,27.0,8.0,32.0,11.0,29.0,1.0,0.242,0.28800000000000003,0.42100000000000004,0.7090000000000001,"Though Gregorius scuffled in an unspectacular 2019 season, there's reason to be optimistic about him moving forward. Despite some rust while working his way back from Tommy John surgery, Gregorius posted the second-best ISO (.204) and AB/HR (20.3) marks of his career. His .238 batting average wasn't pretty, but some bad luck was involved as he suffered from a career-worst .237 BABIP. The Yankee Stadium factor must be considered when projecting the shortstop's power numbers, but subtract a lopsided 2018 campaign and his home/road homer splits during his tenure as a Yankee were dead even (35/35). Besides, Philadelphia is far from the worst place for a lefty hitter to play, and it bears mentioning that Gregorius' barrel rate (5.9%), average exit velocity (88.2 mph) and xSLG (.408) all reached career peaks last season. That bodes well for a bounce-back 2020 campaign even as he adjusts to his new surroundings."
Hunter Dozier,"3B, OF",Royals,523.0,75.0,26.0,84.0,55.0,148.0,2.0,0.27899999999999997,0.348,0.522,0.87,195.0,23.0,8.0,25.0,18.0,58.0,1.0,0.256,0.321,0.467,0.7879999999999999,"A rebuild allows a team to give second chances to players who previously showed little, in hopes that one or two of them will still work out. Dozier leapt at that opportunity in his age-27 season, hitting an impressive .279/.348/.522 in 139 games after entering the year with a .228/.279/.388 line over 110 contests. It did take a .339 BABIP to get there, though that's not an exceptionally high number, and Statcast suggests he overachieved by only a moderate amount, giving him a .261 xBA and a .471 xSLG. If Dozier regresses to those marks this season, he won't be a particularly interesting fantasy option, especially given that he will still have to fight against a tough home park and a mediocre lineup. However, he will at least be a capable cheaper option at either third base or in the outfield."

That sounds like the start of a Hall of Fame career, not the career of a player whose future as a starter appeared to be in serious doubt late last season. The rest of Odor's stat line reveals why the Rangers have grown frustrated with him. While he hit at least 30 homers in three of the last four seasons, he also hit .205 or worse in two of the last three. In 2019, his K% shot up to 30.6 as he managed a poor .205/.283/.439 slash line and played below-average defense. He still looks like a starter for now, but don't be surprised if this is the year Odor moves to the bench."

That locked him into a regular job -- finally! -- entering 2020, where his combination of contact and fly ball stroke give him plenty of breakthrough potential. This is a player as capable of reaching a .290 batting average or 30 homers or -- gasp -- both. He's well worth stashing as your fifth outfielder in the hopes he realizes it."

The power output was surprising, as Newman had totaled only 15 homers in 1,630 career minor-league at-bats and posted a meager 2.1% barrel rate, 24.4% hard-hit rate and 84.7 mph average exit velocity with the Pirates last season. However, his proficient hitting and base-running are backed by promising data. Newman ranked in the 90th percentile last season with a .291 xBA and in the 84th percentile with a sprint speed of 28.5 ft/s. He also displayed superb contact skills, registering an 87.0% contact rate and 11.7 K%, each ranking in the top five among qualified hitters. His potential to hit for a high average while amassing double-digit steals make Newman worth a look in the mid-to-late rounds of fantasy drafts."

He hits lefties well and will call a homer-friendly venue home in Miller Park. These are things that can be exploited more in ESPN's standard daily formats. Garcia is also faster than you realize and has routinely ranked among the top 10-15% in Statcast's sprint speed. As such, another run at double-digit steals isn't entirely out of the question. Regard him as a good late-round pick or a fifth outfielder."

Barnes' continued struggles paved the way for Smith's more permanent promotion in late July, after which he started 39 of the Dodgers' final 57 games while batting .250/.335/.556 with 12 homers and 36 RBIs. Before you embrace him as a budding superstar, though, note how much of his fantasy value was tied to home runs in the rabbit-baseball year. In a similar offensive environment, he could challenge for HR lead at catcher, something that would make him an easy top-five fantasy backstop. However, the holes in his swing could lead to inconsistency, some growing pains and perhaps a low batting average. Smith is a great dynasty pick, but be careful not to have outrageous expectations."

His 146 wRC+ led the team and ranked 12th in the majors among players with at least 350 PA. Canha did many things well, registering a solid 9.5% barrel rate and 89.1 mph average exit velocity while compiling an outstanding 13.5 BB%. He kept his strikeouts in line, too, finishing with a tolerable 21.5 K%. Canha's most notable flaw was a .221 BA against left-handed pitching -- well below the .282 mark he posted in 2018. Expected improvement in that area in 2020 should provide some padding against a potential drop in his .297 average against righties. A lack of steals and a pitcher-friendly home park limit Canha's fantasy ceiling, but he's worth a look in most leagues, particularly those that count OBP."

In the final five weeks of the season, he slashed .330/.377/.526, hit five homers, stole 10 bases and started 23 of 29 Rockies games between three different positions (second base, shortstop and center field). That was probably closer to Hampson's true self, a contact-oriented (80.4% rate), speedy package that could make a significant impact if he gets everyday at-bats. The Rockies would be wise to find places for him across any of those three spots again, and his spring progress could do a lot to push the needle up from his current draft stock: A late-round sleeper with dual eligibility (second base/outfield)."

Not to mention, skipper Mike Shildt appears to be more reliant on running, benefiting Wong. The problem is his supporting data is risky. Yes, some players thrive despite a low hard-hit rate, but their margin for error is thin, resulting in a wide range of outcomes. Wong's average exit velocity is low. This may help him beat out grounders and lead to some dying quails in the outfield, but it's not a profile to elicit confidence. That said, Wong was 24-for-28 in the stolen base department last season, an enticing total in an era featuring dwindling pilfers. Wong's Gold Glove defense will keep him in the lineup though he's likely to hit low in the order, limiting his ability to compile counting stats outside of steals."

He started 41 of the team's first 44 games shuffling between the corner infield spots and DH and hit nine home runs in 180 trips to the plate, matching his entire 2017-18 total between the majors and minors. Unfortunately, injuries -- a hand contusion, hamstring tightness and a foot contusion -- cost him a trio of IL stints totaling 79 lost Rays games thereafter, with health now the bigger question surrounding him entering 2020. Diaz should factor prominently at third base for the team, with good odds of matching or even exceeding his per-game rates from 2019, but he's more of a speculative fantasy corner infielder for mixed leagues with the injury and defensive questions he faces."

His peripherals fell in line with his career norms; Castro rarely walked (4.1 BB%), kept his strikeouts down (16.4 K%) and made good contact (82.5% contact rate). The veteran's steady floor is his most desirable asset from a fantasy perspective. During the past four seasons, his xBA fell between .262 and .271, and his xSLG remained in the .407-.432 range. Those numbers are pretty near league average, which is a fine term to describe Castro's game as a whole. After the Marlins declined his team option, the Nationals scooped him up, and he is likely to start at second base. The move away from Miami could boost his numbers slightly, but it's best to expect another season of average production and treat anything more as a bonus."

Considering the barrage of ailments he has suffered over the past three seasons -- a pair of ankle sprains, vertigo, a fractured right index finger, migraines and a season-ending torn labrum in his shoulder in September, among other minor bumps and bruises -- it's an understandable strategy. It allows him the opportunity to prove himself in a super-utility role (� la Scott Kingery in Philadelphia) rather than trusting him initially on an everyday basis. Senzel showed enough pop and speed between ailments to warrant a stash even in redraft formats, but a strong spring would do a lot to make him a more reliable mid-round pick."

The batting average and lack off running game held down his value, and we should expect more of the same in 2020. Grichuk is not very accepting of walks and has a lot of swing-and-miss in his game. He struggles to hit for average and get on base against righty pitchers. His run-production opportunities will be dependent on where he hits in the lineup. Chances are, Grichuk will hit in the bottom half of the order, unless he can supplant Travis Shaw from his spot in the lineup. The quality of his contact took a step back last season for the first time in three years, so that bears watching."

Opposing pitchers got him to chase high heat before he learned to lay off. Then, right-handed hurlers with the ability to place sweeping sliders off the outside edge were able to get him to fish. Chavis was in the process of making that adjustment when he was shelved with an oblique injury, ending his freshman campaign in mid-August. Entering 2020, Chavis is expected to be healthy. If he can control the zone better, he has plenty of pop and could be a solid contributor to a still-deep lineup. Playing-time opportunities include the small side of a first-base platoon with Mitch Moreland and competing with Jose Peraza, Marco Hernandez and maybe Dustin Pedroia for action at the keystone."

Playing in his third organization in the past two seasons, Urshela shattered his previous professional bests for a single year with 21 home runs, .534 slugging percentage, .219 isolated power and a .314 batting average, with boosts in both his line-drive and hard-contact rates lending legitimacy to the performance. The Yankees' concerns about Andujar's defense should give Urshela a long leash in the race for their 2020 third base gig, so Urshela should remain a regular in the absence of a bad spring.

Besides the lengthy recovery from that ailment, he faces another critical obstacle to success: poor defense, which clouds his 2020 role on a Yankees team where Gio Urshela excelled at the hot corner in his absence. Andujar is untested at either first base or in left field. For fantasy, he is listed as DH-only due to his limited play last year. He could rebound with a stat line not far shy of his 2018 breakthrough, but there are a lot of questions here that make him more of a mid-to-late-round pick."

Consistency is also usually lauded for a player, but even though Mazara has posted an OPS between .739 and .787 each season of his four-year career, the narrative is that the former top prospect has not developed as hoped. Though, to be fair, he did post career highs in batting average and slugging last season. Skills-wise, Mazara is league average across the board, from contact to exit velocity to sprint speed. Maybe a change in scenery can trigger some improvement as the Rangers dealt Mazara to the South Side of Chicago, where he's ticketed to patrol right field. Although it's still too early in his career to pigeonhole Mazara as a platoon bat, he's headed that way with a career 103 wRC+ versus right-handers compared with 59 facing southpaws."

That said, with the Rays, he should lose less playing time, in large part due to his excellent defense, an underappreciated aspect of his game. Jose Martinez and Yoshi Tsutsugo will compete with Renfroe for outfield action, but neither are the defender he is, nor do they possess the power. The main hole in Renfroe's game is contact as he fanned at a career-worst 31% clip last season. However, he's an extreme flyball hitter with an average exit velocity on flyballs of 95.9 mph, well above the 93.0 mph league mark. While this supports bountiful long balls, the tandem of strikeouts and flyball outs yield a low batting average while limiting run production relative to the homer total. He's also a liability in OBP leagues with a career 7% walk rate."

In 2019, he maintained the increased fly ball rate (18.6%) that coincided with the power surge, but both his hard-hit rate and barrel rate dipped closer to pre-2018 levels. In turn, he slugged only 12 long balls, finishing with a 31.8 AB/HR ratio that fell in line with his career norm. A shoulder injury that hampered Peralta all season (and prematurely ended his campaign in early September) likely contributed to the regression, but it's also a gamble to assume his 2018 production was anything more than an outlier. Peralta can be safely counted on for steady hitting -- particularly against right-handers -- and double-digit homers, but it will take a leap of faith to count on above-average numbers in the power department."

Those critics were silenced with a career year. What goes up must come down, however, and that is what happened to Carpenter in 2019 as his production took a tumble. The shoulder did not fail him, but back and foot problems did, causing him to fall below 550 plate appearances for the first time since 2012. When a hitter's core and base fail him, the results are going to suffer. It makes it difficult to hit with the quality of contact necessary to be successful. Carpenter's exit velocity and launch angle fell more than two percentage points with the injuries. A repeat of 2018 is unlikely, but you can expect something in the 2015-17 average range, assuming his health issues are behind him."

Swanson ranked 10th among qualified hitters in line-drive rate last season (25.8%) and Statcast says he deserved to hit 20 points higher than he actually did in 2019. Statcast data is more descriptive than predictive, but the batted-ball numbers do provide reason for optimism moving forward. Swanson is now entering his age-26 season and still graded out as a below-league-average hitter last season, even with his improvement. Shortstop has gotten incredibly deep -- deeper than any position in fantasy baseball -- and Swanson tends to get lost in the shuffle. However, there is playing-time stability here and Atlanta should frequently turn over the batting order. There's potentially some profit to be made using a late-round pick on Swanson to fill the middle-infield spot."

He continued to show good patience and pop. However, his 26.2% strikeout rate raised some concerns about his consistency and full-year batting average, and a trade to the Padres did take him out of one of the most HR-friendly venues in baseball (Miller Park) and land him in one that leans more toward pitchers (Petco Park). Grisham should grab a regular job for his new team, though, and his 25-HR power and double-digit SB ability makes him worth a No. 5 OF/late-round selection in rotisserie leagues."

Surgery was necessary, delaying his 2019 debut until late May. By this time, there were reports the 2019 ball was different, adding several feet to a well-hit fly ball. Seager's underlying power metrics were such he could benefit more than most. It took a while to manifest, but sure enough, Seager went on a tear after the break, hitting 17 second-half home runs. He finished with a career-best .229 ISO. Seager's bat still has some pop, and aside from last spring's fluke injury, he's been quite durable, averaging 157 games per season from 2012-18, helping to compile runs and RBIs. Corner infield isn't as deep as normal; in fact, it's shallower than middle infield. He's not sexy, but Seager can still provide reliable cheap power, albeit with a low batting average."

The White Sox claim he'll get a long look in their spring second base race, and considering the team might have wild-card aspirations, it's entirely possible he'll run away with the gig. But even if Madrigal's big-league debut waits until May or June -- remember those service time worries! -- he should immediately become one of the more attractive speedsters in fantasy, and one of the better ones in points leagues too because of his elite contact.

Goodrum does not have the power typically associated with this level of swinging and missing, but he has 92nd-percentile sprint speed and puts those wheels to use just enough to be relevant in deeper mixed leagues (12-for-15 on stolen-base attempts last season). The multi-position eligibility certainly helps his case. This skill set will not move the needle much, but there is value in the speed and flexibility he offers."

Unfortunately, Schoop reverted to his aggressive ways, swinging at more pitches out of the zone, and his numbers suffered. The drop in production cost Schoop playing time the past two years, to the point the Twins designated him for assignment following a 2019 campaign during which he played just 121 games, his lowest total since 2015. Schoop still possesses plus power, fueled by an average exit velocity on fly balls higher than the league norm. Schoop is just 28 years old, young enough to make adjustments and approach 2017's level. He picked an ideal place for the endeavor, signing with Detroit, where he's earmarked for regular playing time at the keystone, hitting in the meat of the order. He's worth a speculative dart if you need some cheap pop."
Austin Hays,OF,Orioles,68.0,12.0,4.0,13.0,7.0,13.0,2.0,0.309,0.373,0.574,0.9470000000000001,200.0,27.0,9.0,27.0,10.0,55.0,3.0,0.235,0.27699999999999997,0.41,0.687,"After a year-plus of injury troubles, Hays got a cup of coffee with an Orioles team bereft of talent at the big-league level, filling the five pertinent rotisserie categories despite a contact rate out of character with his minor league track record. He'll face similarly light competition for at-bats entering 2020, but for all of the volume-driven appeal, he might not yet be ready to perform at the level of a top-30 fantasy outfielder. Hays is well worth the roll of the dice as your fifth mixed league outfielder, or as an AL-only mid-to-late rounder, but let him prove himself with a full year of success before you invest more."

After hitting only 10 home runs through his first 922 major-league at-bats, Vazquez slugged 23 long balls in 482 trips to the plate last season, seventh most among catchers. The transformation can largely be attributed to adjustments in his batting stance and the juiced baseball. While Vazquez's fly ball rate (25.1%) and average launch angle (12.9 degrees) remained relatively constant, his hard-hit rate jumped significantly to a career-best 33.6%, and his 6.2% barrel rate more than tripled his paltry 2018 mark. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the 5-foot-9 backstop's growth -- he outperformed both his xBA and xSLG -- but even with some power regression, he should see enough volume (thanks in part to his ability to play multiple infield positions) to be viable as a first catcher."

In 2018, Profar hit .254 with 20 homers. Translated to Oakland, that's .236 with 16 homers. In 2019 with the Athletics, Profar hit .218, a drop of 18 points from the adjusted mark. If a batter hits .270 instead of .288, hardly anyone would bat an eyelash. Profar's added power last season reflects the funky baseball. Profar enters his age-27 season with his third team in three years as the Padres acquired the former top prospect in the offseason. Petco Park plays similarly to RingCentral Coliseum, so Profar should be expected to bat close to the .236 expected mark discussed above with similar power. Bottom line is Profar is a below-average hitter, only useful in the deeper formats."

But the home run boundary was lowered in Anaheim, while a humidor was installed in the desert, flip-flopping the venues and then some. Last season, Calhoun blasted a career-high 33 homers but curiously only 16 at home. He was no doubt helped by the 2019 baseball, as his average fly ball distance was by far a personal best despite no change to his Statcast power metrics. Not only is Calhoun unlikely to match last season's power surge, his strikeout rate increased for the third straight season. Additionally, while he was never a burner, Calhoun's sprint speed is in decline and he finished in the 30th percentile last season. Calhoun's defense will keep him in the lineup, but beware a low batting average with waning power."

He'll probably settle as the team's regular center fielder due to his above-average range, arm and raw speed. From 2017-19, Akiyama slashed .316/.398/.514 while averaging 23 homers and 14 stolen bases in Japan, and while those won't necessarily directly translate in the States, they show a skillset that might make a significantly greater impact in points leagues than rotisserie, especially if he continues to walk frequently and draws a top-two-in-the-order lineup spot. In those points formats, Akiyama is a worthy final-outfielder flier, and a strong spring would boost that value and make him that caliber player in roto, too."

That set the tone for his entire 2019; Dickerson also missed time with groin and finger injuries before a fractured left foot sidelined him for good. In between, Dickerson was excellent, hitting .300 for the fourth time in his career -- the second time not playing home games of Coors Field -- with his highest ISO ever. His strikeout rate ticked up, but 20.1% is still quite good in this era. Given all the missed time last season, it's easy to forget about Dickerson and how consistently good he's been with the bat. Previously, injuries had not been a major problem, with Dickerson logging at least 533 PA in each of the three seasons prior to 2019, so he's arguably not much more of an injury risk than any other position player. After signing a two-year deal with the Marlins, Dickerson is slated to play every day."

Prior to the move, the 30-year-old was slashing .252/.303/.475. He posted a .297/.377/.423 line after. For the season, Puig's numbers were consistent with his career norms. With Cleveland, Puig's on-base skills improved, but his power dipped. However, while Puig hit only two homers after the trade, he clubbed 15 doubles. The venue change likely contributed, but he was also snake bit based on average fly ball distance. Steals have always been an underappreciated aspect of Puig's arsenal, and a career-high 19 last season bodes well for his value in a category where the overall numbers are dwindling. The hope for immense upside is over, replaced with an often-discounted but stable floor."

He started slowly with the bat but turned it on over the final two months, finishing with a respectable .278/.340/.467 batting line (115 wRC+) after the All-Star break. Adames shaved four percentage points off his strikeout rate from the first half to the second half and added more than 40 points to his ISO. It's important to remember that he was still just 23 years old for most of last season and was once a top prospect in the system. The Rays now have uber-prospect Wander Franco waiting in the wings, but if Adames can hit like he did in the second half, he could force the team to break Franco in at second base."

His overall skills remain strong, but his ability to showcase those skills has been compromised by injuries to his elbow, thumb and groin. Pollock has the skills and athleticism to go 20-20 in a season, as he did back in 2015 when he was on the field enough to do so. Around the injuries and ups and downs in the counting categories, Pollock has had very little variance in his triple-slash categories, both in terms of his actual BA/OBP/SLG and his expected performances in those statistical categories based on his quality of contact. The Dodgers' lineup is loaded with talent, so Pollock cannot afford another injury-riddled season, as he may not get back into the lineup. Big contracts do not always guarantee playing time."

Unfortunately, the 28-year-old hasn't been healthy since injuring his shoulder late in the 2018 campaign and is not guaranteed to be 100 percent when the 2020 season begins. Polanco attempted to return from the injury in 2019 but logged only 166 PA before being shut down. When he did play, Polanco struggled to hit the ball, as both his contact rate (68.0%) and strikeout rate (29.3%) were easily the worst marks of his career. If there's any good news to take from the abbreviated campaign, it's that Polanco's barrel rate (9.6%) and average exit velocity (89.4 mph) remained considerably above league average. Polanco may be worth a late-round dart throw for those in mixed leagues looking to address a homer/steals deficit with one pick, but it would behoove such gamblers to monitor his health closely."

Much of it seemed to be Coors-influenced, though, and Hilliard's batted-ball and hard-contact metrics suggested he was performing a bit above his true talent. He'll be in the mix for a reserve role for the big club this spring, but would only warrant greater than a speculative NL-only pick if he emerges with at least a share of one of their outfield jobs."

A fractured tibia cost him most of the final three months of last season and prevented him from reaching a new high in plate appearances, but his performance when healthy vaulted him into a whole new level. Over 80 games he hit .295/.346/.486 with 16 homers and a tiny 8.7 K%. Breakouts at his age are certainly surprising, but Statcast backs up his success, giving him a .296 xBA and a .482 xSLG. It's hard not to like a player who now has decent power to go along with excellent contact ability. With a regular role at second base open, La Stella is worth consideration this draft season."

He finished third on the team in plate appearances, behind DJ LeMahieu and Gleyber Torres, and had his best season by wRC+ since 2012. Thanks in no small part to the reduced drag on the big-league baseball, Gardner finished just two homers shy of 30, with 16 of his 28 coming away from Yankee Stadium. His running waned, but he was still plenty efficient on his 12 attempts in his age-35 season. He was a free agent for several months after the 2019 season, and those few months of uncertainty have driven down his ADP, certainly lower than it should be. A case can be made that Gardner, back in the middle of the New York lineup after re-upping on a one-year deal, should go inside the top 200 picks."

Kelly's .826 OPS was a respectable fifth among catchers with at least 300 plate appearances, while his 18 homers tied for 10th at the position. His defense improved, and Kelly finished with two defensive runs saved. An 88th-percentile framing grade was the driving force as his 55th-percentile pop time was just a little better than average. At the dish, Kelly's 21.6 K% was higher than previous levels, though a significant jump to a 13.2 BB% eases concerns. After playing about half the time last season, Kelly is in line for a bump in playing time, but with Stephen Vogt signed as a backup, Kelly won't play as much as some regulars. Still, he's a back-end option in one-catcher formats."

He was off to a sluggish start, slashing .200/.344/.323 on May 22 when he when he was put on the IL with a stiff neck. Tests revealed a bulging disc and whiplash, incurred during an outfield collision in mid-April. The injury had been bothering Nimmo, no doubt contributing to his struggles. He didn't return until rosters expanded, slashing a much-improved .262/.430/.565, drawing 20 walks to 23 strikeouts in 93 plate appearances. He swatted five homers down the stretch, stealing a pair of bags as well. The Mets acquired Jake Marisnick in the offseason, a natural platoon partner for Nimmo. However, Nimmo posted a 1.190 OPS facing southpaws last season so he may be given the chance at everyday at-bats."

A bum elbow certainly contributed to his poor finish, as he hit .231/.320/.385 the rest of the way with a 36% strikeout rate. He has an established track record of hitting the ball well in between all the swings and misses. He has some of the best expected results on batted-ball contact in baseball, but those events are too few and far between with the growing strikeout rate. Santana will compete for at-bats in the Indians' outfield during spring training."

It all went wrong from there, however, as he slumped to an awful .150/.203/.292 line with just four homers over his final 38 contests. His 42.3 K% over that latter stretch was untenably high, though his 32.2% mark while things were going well wasn't exactly good either. Riley should have a clear path to playing time at third base this season with Josh Donaldson gone, if not as the team's designated hitter. He's still just 22 years old, so there's certainly a chance things go better in his sophomore season. His combination of big raw power and contact concerns is right in line with his prospect reports, however, so there's plenty of risk that the swing-and-miss issues will remain prevalent in 2020."

Enter Murphy's Law, which states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. The first weekend of the season, Murphy fractured his left index finger diving for a ball, and it was all downhill from there. He returned about four weeks later but wasn't right for the rest of the season. Murphy's average exit velocity was its lowest since Statcast began its tracking in 2015. Moreover, his line drive and fly ball rates dropped while his strikeouts grew. Even though Coors Field is better for hits than power, Murphy posted his lowest average since 2009. Murphy is currently tops on Colorado's depth chart at first base, though the Rockies do have some younger (and arguably better) options than a veteran entering his age-35 season. Murphy is in play in deeper leagues and formats with daily moves."

Myers stands to see his playing time take another hit this year with the acquisitions of Tommy Pham and Trent Grisham to the outfield, and for good reason. Myers has been a disappointment the past two seasons, with average production. The contract is friendly enough that he could be traded to another organization, but until that happens, be very concerned about his ability to get enough playing time to even sniff what he did just two seasons ago. The expected statistics tell us not to look for a return to what he once was and to recognize what he is now: just an average player with a recognizable name."

His ability to hit for average and get on base were obvious even in limited duty in previous seasons, but he was able to extend that out with extra playing time, and he added more loft to his swing to take full advantage of the bouncy baseball. While his average exit velocity has remained constant, his fly ball rate has grown from 29% to 41% over the past three seasons. It will be interesting to see how much playing time Milwaukee is willing to give Narvaez behind the plate, where he grades out as a terrible catcher, both as a thrower and a framer.

Shaw was already hitting fly balls at a 45% clip -- a rate more than sufficient to take advantage of Miller Park. However, last season, Shaw adjusted his swing and increased his average launch angle while his fly ball rate soared to 50%. In the process, he almost doubled his strikeout rate fanning 33% of the time. In addition, his fly ball exit velocity fell. The combination harpooned Shaw's average and power as he slashed an anemic .157/.281/.270. The Blue Jays are hoping a reversion to his previous swing buoys a rebound as they have signed Shaw to replace Justin Smoak at first base. Even though it costs next to nothing to see if Shaw can rediscover his power stroke, it's only worth the dart throw in the deepest of formats."

He seemed to sacrifice some of it in the pursuit of greater power around a barrage of injuries, hitting 14 home runs with .290 isolated power in 41 second-half games between the majors and minors. Whether he can maintain those rates is a legitimate question, but he has paths to decent-yet-not-spectacular numbers in batting average and home runs. With more luck in the health department, Murphy could squeak into the top 10 at his position and should be drafted keeping that potential in mind."
Mike Yastrzemski,OF,Giants,371.0,64.0,21.0,55.0,32.0,107.0,2.0,0.272,0.33399999999999996,0.518,0.852,170.0,29.0,8.0,23.0,16.0,52.0,1.0,0.253,0.321,0.45899999999999996,0.78,"Yastrzemski may be no match for his grandfather Carl, but his strong season as a 28-year-old rookie put him on the map as a legitimate big-league talent following a long slog through the minors. He managed 21 homers in 107 games while hitting .272/.334/.518. Statcast bought into his power, giving him an xSLG of .510. While his 26.0 K% and 7.8 BB% were each worse than league average, neither was poor enough to be a serious red flag. Yastrzemski's numbers will continue to be held down this season by a tough home park and a mediocre surrounding lineup, though the Giants' unimpressive roster also means there's less competition for playing time. He didn't play much against lefties last season, but that could change this year after he posted a .943 OPS against them over 89 PA. That would give him even more opportunities to contribute counting stats."
Miguel Cabrera,"1B, DH",Tigers,492.0,41.0,12.0,59.0,48.0,108.0,0.0,0.28300000000000003,0.34700000000000003,0.39799999999999996,0.745,167.0,15.0,4.0,21.0,17.0,37.0,0.0,0.26899999999999996,0.337,0.38299999999999995,0.72,"Nothing good lasts forever. That's true even when speaking of Cabrera's dominance. One of the premier hitters of his generation, the future Hall of Famer's numbers have fallen off a cliff as he has progressed through his mid-30s. Sure, Cabrera can still swing the bat -- he hit .285 over the past two seasons -- but his power numbers have taken such a tumble that they're not even league average anymore. In fact, Cabrera's .116 ISO ranked seventh worst among qualified hitters last season, falling squarely between Lorenzo Cain and Hanser Alberto. Injuries certainly bear much of the blame, but given Cabrera's age and body type, he's unlikely to suddenly regain perfect health. The Tigers will continue to reserve a spot in the lineup for the veteran due to his large contract and on-base skills, but his days of being a reliable run producer are long gone."
Jon Berti,"SS, 3B, OF",Marlins,256.0,52.0,6.0,24.0,24.0,73.0,17.0,0.273,0.348,0.406,0.755,163.0,25.0,4.0,17.0,16.0,42.0,10.0,0.252,0.332,0.39299999999999996,0.7240000000000001,"Under ordinary circumstances, a 30-year-old with 77 games of big-league appearances and a merely decent .273/.344/.410 slash line wouldn't be worth a second look. When that player has stolen 18 bases over that small sample, however, the story is different, especially in a speed-starved era. If Berti were younger, he'd be one of the Marlins' more appealing assets and would likely be able to carve out a significant role for himself this season, but it's just not clear if a veteran his age fits the team's competitive timeline. His ability to play both shortstop and center field goes a long way toward keeping him on the roster in a bench role, but he may not be anything more than that. As long as he plays occasionally, he'll run enough to matter in deep leagues, but his forgettable bat and uncertain role limit his appeal in shallower formats."
Anthony Santander,OF,Orioles,380.0,46.0,20.0,59.0,19.0,86.0,1.0,0.261,0.297,0.47600000000000003,0.773,190.0,23.0,7.0,26.0,10.0,44.0,1.0,0.242,0.281,0.41100000000000003,0.691,"Santander spent a fair portion of 2019 in the big leagues and showed good power, hitting 20 homers over 405 PA. The full package wasn't all that impressive, however, as his lopsided .261/.297/.476 slash line was good for a below-average 97 wRC+. That's fine for someone occupying center field, where Santander started 20 games, but the defensive metrics suggest he should probably be limited to the corners. Santander's main weakness at the plate was a 4.7 BB%, though that's a bigger dent to his real-life utility than it is to his fantasy value, outside of OBP leagues. In theory, a young hitter who has shown at least something at the plate and plays in a hitter-friendly home park should make for a fairly safe late-round bet. Beware, though, that Santander doesn't have the pedigree to lock him into an everyday role if his numbers slip."

He hit .263/.323/.459 with 16 homers in 92 games for his new team, hitting well enough to earn himself 16 starts at first base. The performance was enough to earn him a two-year deal with Atlanta, where his exact playing-time split with Tyler Flowers remains to be seen. D'Arnaud's recent success would seem to give him the advantage, and Statcast gives reason to buy his improvements, giving him an xBA and an xSLG each within four points of his actual numbers. D'Arnaud lacks the track record to push towards the top tier of catchers, but an approximate repeat of last season's showing would be perfectly acceptable."
Robinson Cano,2B,Mets,390.0,46.0,13.0,39.0,25.0,69.0,0.0,0.256,0.307,0.428,0.736,152.0,20.0,5.0,20.0,11.0,26.0,0.0,0.27,0.325,0.434,0.76,"Based on Cano's 2019 numbers, it's easy to conclude that age is finally catching up to the 15-year veteran, given his durability and performance issues. A closer look suggests that could be only half right, pointing toward a rebound in Cano's age-37 campaign. As to the health concerns, Cano averaged 159 games from 2007 to 2017. In 2018, he would have missed time with a broken pinkie if he hadn't been suspended for 80 games. Last year, he battled through hand, quad and hamstring issues, the latter two resulting in IL stints. Cano is at the age where injuries tend to mount. On the other hand, between the lines, Statcast suggests Cano was just as dangerous as ever, posting an 82nd-percentile average exit velocity and an 87th-percentile hard-hit rate. Even though he fanned a little more, his 16% strikeout rate is still low. There's risk, but it's baked into a big market discount."

Before the end of April he had earned a big-league promotion as Trea Turner's injury fill-in. Kieboom showed some pop in that 11-game audition, but proved otherwise overmatched, after which point he batted .289/.391/.458 with 12 homers in his 90 season-ending games for Fresno. He's expected to be in the Nationals' 3B mix this spring, with several in-season options for playing time across the infield. His top-prospect status and balanced categorical contributions make him an appealing stash even if he fails in his quest to make the Opening Day roster."

The switch-hitter does all of his power damage from the left side yet hits for a better average from the right, but neither skill is going to earn him starts on an everyday basis with Ryan Braun likely playing some first to keep his bat in the lineup. The best path forward for Smoak's playing time is an injury to an outfielder (which would force Braun back into an OF-only role), but he will at least see plenty of action as the DH against righties in interleague play. As things look on paper, it will be tough for Smoak to accumulate a significant number of plate appearances in 2020, which will be an unfortunate waste of his ability to hit the ball with authority. He should have signed with a non-contending AL team."

By all scouts' accounts, his glove is clearly ready for it, and he did turn in a .293/.350/.488 slash line and 18 home runs in 92 games for Double-A Arkansas that gives hope he can contribute some with the bat. Make no mistake: White is regarded more of a line-drive than raw-power type, and it's unclear how quickly he'll be able to generate the contact and extra-base ability points-league managers require from a corner infielder. He's more of a dart throw in mixed leagues, and more so in rotisserie, than someone in whom to fully invest."

He finally got going and earned a call-up to Chicago shortly after the All-Star break. Happ appeared in 58 games down the stretch, but only 39 of those were starts, split between the outfield, second base, third and first. He's OF-only in leagues with a 20-game minimum. In his limited run with the big club (156 PA), Happ slugged .564 with a much-improved 25.0 K%. He also graded out better on defense. It was a good showing after a disappointing 2018, but it will assure him nothing in 2020. Happ will need to fare well in spring training and impress new manager David Ross to secure a spot in the Opening Day lineup."

A pair of trips to the injured list were partially to blame, but he also didn't do enough while healthy to carve out a larger role, hitting .262/.311/.411 (good for just a 91 wRC+) with a 35.1 K%. That strikeout rate works for a batter with Joey Gallo-level power, but O'Neill doesn't seem to have that despite his impressive biceps. Neither his 37.2% hard-hit rate nor his 89.2 mph exit velocity would have ranked in the top 100 among qualified batters. Still just 24, there's certainly still a chance he figures out how to make more contact and tap into more power, but a future as a bench bat looms, especially with highly-rated prospect Dylan Carlson knocking on the door."

Smith rose to the challenge, however, making the Opening Day roster and hitting .282/.355/.525 with 11 homers over 197 PA before missing most of the second half with a broken foot. That's an encouraging sample, though it's still a small one, and Statcast doesn't fully buy in, giving him an xBA of .246 and an xSLG of .445. Additionally, his defensive work in the outfield -- where he played primarily last season -- graded out poorly. Put it all together and Smith probably fits best as a bench bat. If injuries or a trade to a team that doesn't employ Alonso opens up more playing time, Smith's bat is good enough to merit consideration, but he's not worth much in his current situation."

The Rays added Yoshi Tsutsugo and Jose Martinez this winter, and they still have former top prospect Nate Lowe, Brandon Lowe and Yandy Diaz, all of whom can play Choi's position at first base. Choi hit just .210/.309/.321 against left-handed pitching, and given what is known about the Rays' tendencies and roster construction, it seems safe to say Choi will almost exclusively be used against righties. Strict platoon players are passable in some mixed-league formats, but the platoon role puts a cap on his upside. The risk of decreased at-bats against right-handers exists if Choi gets off to a slow start or one of his teammates lights the world on fire."

He'll not only be trying to prove his health during spring training, but also that he's capable of locking down a regular spot with the Mets, two significant hurdles to clear. That the Mets have a designated hitter spot in which to stash him, however, does boost his appeal as an NL-only late rounder."

A solid month of June, during which he hit .315 inspired hope of a dramatic turnaround, but his average fell below the Mendoza Line each of the following two months and ultimately settled at .225 by the end of the campaign. That isn't far from his career .236 mark, solidifying Bradley's reputation as a batting-average drain. The veteran's primary problem is making contact. In 2019, he registered a 69.4% contact rate and 27.3% strikeout rate, each among the worst marks in the league. Bradley did notch a solid 9.9 BB%, but that's hardly enough to make up for his contact issues, especially because he did not approach the 17 steals he posted in 2018. Bradley will continue to be a star on defense, but the sample size is large enough to set low expectations regarding his contributions at the plate."

In 406 PA last season he hit .205/.314/.366 with a 28.8 K%, far too high a rate for a player without any real power. A .268 BABIP held his numbers down somewhat, but it's hard to hit for a high average when you just don't hit the ball very hard, and Statcast gave him an xBA of .219. The Cardinals figure to give him enough at-bats to matter in deeper formats, at least early on, and the speed is there for him to steal double-digit bases. If his bat does not come along, however, Dexter Fowler, Lane Thomas or Dylan Carlson could take over in center field and send Bader to the bench."

In 2019, he enjoyed his best season at the plate, as his .257 xBA, .422 xSLG and 92 wRC+ were all career highs. Ahmed chipped in just enough counting stats -- 19 home runs, 82 RBIs and eight stolen bases -- to appear on the radar in mixed leagues for the first time. Per his career norm, the right-hander struggled against same-handed pitchers (.234 average), but he otherwise didn't do anything particularly poorly. Both his strikeout rate (18.1%) and contact rate (79.8%) were slightly better than league average, and his 8.3 BB% was the best of his career.

That he calls one of the friendlier offensive environments his home, and that he should be a regular in one of the game's most improved offenses from the offseason, will only help inflate his perceived draft stock. However, Aquino batted just .196/.236/.382 with a 30.9% strikeout rate in his last 27 September games, as opposing pitchers began exploiting the holes in his swing. Regression could hit this sophomore hard in 2020, with streakiness due to his strikeouts the biggest concern.

Those weren't a far cry from his .300/85.9% career minor league rates, traits that make him a high-floor prospect even if he's lacking in patience, has slowed on the base paths after 2018 ACL surgery and probably isn't the 24-homer performer he was bettern the majors and minors in 2019. Dubon is the kind of �safe� middle infield pick NL-only managers should appreciate as a fallback, but he'd need to make some sort of significant adjustment to register on the mixed-league radar."

In each of the past three seasons, he hit between .276 and .278 while posting single-digit walk rates and strikeout rates in the mid-teens. He also slugged exactly 10 home runs in each of the past two campaigns and did so in over 250 fewer plate appearances in 2018. Frazier doesn't hit the ball very hard, but he has managed to sustain a useful batting average due to a superb contact rate that grew to a career-best 86.5% last season. While he consistently racked up double-digit stolen-base totals in the minors, Frazier's sprint speed is merely average, and he has yet to swipe more than nine bases in a season in the majors. That detracts from his fantasy value considerably, as he doesn't do enough in any particular category to make him rosterable in most mixed leagues."
Dylan Carlson,OF,Cardinals,,,,,,,,,,,,143.0,24.0,6.0,17.0,14.0,34.0,3.0,0.266,0.335,0.47600000000000003,0.8109999999999999,"Coming off a .292/.372/.542, 26 homer, 20 steal season in 126 games combined between Double-A Springfield and Triple-A Memphis, Carlson should contend for the Cardinals' starting right field role during spring training. His breakthrough was seemingly yet another launch-angle project, trading some contact for pop, albeit not enough to threaten his batting average dropping into the danger zone. Keep an eye on Carlson throughout spring training, as his emergence as an Opening Day starter would thrust him directly into the late-round mix in rotisserie leagues, and thanks to his double-digit annual walk rates he'd be even more attractive in points-based formats."
David Fletcher,"3B, 2B, SS, OF",Angels,596.0,83.0,6.0,49.0,55.0,64.0,8.0,0.29,0.35,0.384,0.7340000000000001,173.0,23.0,1.0,15.0,13.0,21.0,3.0,0.28300000000000003,0.335,0.37,0.705,"Standing 5-foot-9, 185 pounds, Fletcher has a short, whippy swing and puts bat to ball with exceptional consistency. His 3.2% swinging-strike rate was the lowest among qualified hitters last season. He rarely expands his small strike zone, and as one would expect of a player with a 10.2 K% in 234 career games, Fletcher has hit for a high average in the big leagues (.285). That average has been rather empty and severely lacking in terms of power, but Fletcher did fill up the runs column last season while leading off in 81 games, and his eight steals were nothing to sneeze at. The dearth of home runs makes him tough to roster in 12-team mixed leagues in this extreme-power era, even with four-position eligibility. His utility in 15-teamers will depend in large part on how often he sits atop the batting order under new manager Joe Maddon."
Yoshitomo Tsutsugo,OF,Rays,,,,,,,,,,,,127.0,17.0,7.0,19.0,19.0,40.0,0.0,0.26,0.358,0.47200000000000003,0.831,"A power bat with patience who comes with defensive questions, Tsutsugo signed with the Rays after four consecutive seasons in Japan with at least 24 doubles, 28 home runs, a .388 OBP and a .511 slugging percentage. This should appeal especially to those of you in points-based leagues. The team plans to test him at third base and in left field in addition to DH, with third base (a position scouts don't feel he's up to on a regular basis ) being the clearest on the roster. However, on this mix-and-match squad, there should be plenty of opportunities for the lefty hitter nevertheless. If Tsutsugo seems to be adapting to U.S. pitching quickly in the spring, he'll elevate his draft stock to a late-round pick even in ESPN standard leagues. At the onset, he's surely a mid-to-late AL-only pick."
Tom Murphy,C,Mariners,260.0,32.0,18.0,40.0,19.0,87.0,2.0,0.273,0.324,0.535,0.858,138.0,15.0,7.0,19.0,9.0,53.0,1.0,0.217,0.268,0.435,0.703,"Finally granted a piece of a timeshare following his first-week trade to the Mariners, Murphy flashed the power potential we'd all awaited for years. His 6.4% HR rate and .262 ISO were both fourth-best among catcher-eligibles. He also performed better than expected behind the plate, locking him into at least that role entering 2020. Murphy's history of 30%-plus strikeouts threaten to drag down his batting average and make him streaky, but there's enough pop in his bat to warrant a selection as a No. 2 catcher in mixed leagues."
Eric Thames,1B,Nationals,396.0,67.0,25.0,61.0,51.0,140.0,3.0,0.247,0.34600000000000003,0.505,0.851,174.0,31.0,10.0,27.0,22.0,59.0,2.0,0.24100000000000002,0.335,0.489,0.8240000000000001,"Thames saw 62 PA against lefties in 2019, which is likely 50 more than he will see against them as a member of the Nationals in 2020. Thames will likely serve as the primary first baseman for the Nationals, but Howie Kendrick and Yan Gomes figure to take on the at-bats against lefties. Thames has the on-base abilities to hit in the upper half of a batting order, which makes him a very intriguing play, even with the limited playing time. Back-to-back seasons of strikeout rates over 30 percent temper the excitement of Thames taking things to another level, as that amount of swinging and missing may make it tough for Davey Martinez to leave Thames up in the lineup on a consistent basis. A drop lower in the lineup should facilitate a drop from your roster, even with plenty of runners likely getting on base in front of him."

While it didn't result in big power numbers, he did finish the year with .305/.355/.511 rates in 46 second-half games, those somewhat inflated by a .358 BABIP but still notable considering the dearth of quality catchers in fantasy these days. He'll enter spring training competing for the lion's share of the team's catching chores, with his shaky defense behind the plate his primary obstacle. It's best to project a 50/50 share with Austin Hedges, but even in that limited time Mejia should provide enough to be a worthy mixed-league No. 2 backstop."
Mike Tauchman,OF,Yankees,260.0,46.0,13.0,46.0,34.0,71.0,6.0,0.273,0.358,0.5,0.858,97.0,15.0,3.0,14.0,11.0,23.0,2.0,0.258,0.336,0.433,0.769,"Another of the Yankees' fill-in success stories in what was an injury-plagued season for the 2019 squad, Tauchman rode a small rise in his launch angle and a second-half starting opportunity to a .315/.396/.566 slash line, eight home runs, 29 RBIs and five stolen bases while starting 42 of 50 Yankees games between July 18 and Sept. 8, before he, too, had his season cut short on the latter date due to a calf strain. Thanks in large part to his good defense and the Yankees outfielders' injury histories, Tauchman should again make the Opening Day roster, with the chance he could steal some time if bad luck strikes the roster again. A repeat seems unlikely, considering his hard-contact rate was so-so, but he has enough pop, smarts on the base paths and patience to be a helpful AL-only late-rounder or plug-in for mixed league managers."
Jason Heyward,OF,Cubs,513.0,78.0,21.0,62.0,68.0,110.0,8.0,0.251,0.34299999999999997,0.429,0.772,155.0,23.0,5.0,20.0,19.0,29.0,1.0,0.265,0.34700000000000003,0.419,0.7659999999999999,"Heyward experienced a power resurgence last season, posting his most home runs (21) and highest ISO (.177) since 2012. Neither his average launch angle nor average exit velocity saw significant jumps, but Heyward succeeded in hitting a greater number of well-struck balls, as his 5.9% barrel rate more than doubled his mark from the previous campaign. The increased focus on power took a toll on the left-hander's strikeout rate (18.7%, his highest in seven seasons) and batting average (.251, down 19 points from 2018), but the tradeoff was positive in light of Heyward's increased run production. That said, it's highly unlikely that the 30-year-old is primed for a late-career venture into elite power territory, and Heyward's reduced stolen-base totals -- he hasn't reached double-digit thefts since 2016 -- lessen his luster considerably. In mixed leagues, there are better gambles to take with your last bench spot."
Stephen Piscotty,OF,Athletics,357.0,46.0,13.0,44.0,29.0,84.0,2.0,0.249,0.309,0.41200000000000003,0.72,146.0,21.0,6.0,20.0,14.0,34.0,1.0,0.253,0.325,0.43200000000000005,0.757,"Piscotty's numbers were limited by injury for the second time in three seasons. He struggled with two major lower-half injuries (knee, ankle), which clearly impacted his ability to maintain the power gains he showcased in 2018. Part of his breakout season in 2018 was tied to him handling righties extremely well compared to other full seasons. His .841 OPS against righties in 2018 was nearly 100 points better than that of any previous season, and the 220-point fall last year was part of his overall statistical demise. Oakland does not have a clear platoon partner for Piscotty, so the full-time job will likely remain his, but if he does not get back to at least league average against righties, his overall numbers will continue to underwhelm."

He'll probably return there to begin the year, but could move quickly with a similarly strong output to the .308/.390/.553 he slashed in Double-A to begin last season. Adell is one of the top dynasty league prospects to stash, and in redraft leagues, he's well worth a speculative pick on the hopes of a midseason callup, should your league afford you the requisite bench space or minor league spots."

The veteran did improve last season, though his .238 BA was hardly reason to celebrate. Fowler's poor hitting was rooted in his declining contact skills, as his 75.2% contact rate and 24.7 K% were each the worst marks of his career. When he did hit the ball, Fowler generated a meager 85.2 mph average exit velocity, placing him in the bottom 10th percentile league wide. With that in mind, it's irrational to expect him to repeat last season's career-best mark of 19 home runs. Fowler deserves some credit for finding other ways to reach base -- he was hit by a pitch eight times and notched a solid 12.9 BB% -- but that's not enough to make him fantasy-viable, especially in light of his declining stolen-base numbers."

In his first audition with the Blue Jays in 2018 (95 PA), Jansen hit .247/.347/.432 with three homers and a 17.9 K%, good for a 116 wRC+. He did not come close to matching those rate numbers in 2019, providing a lesson against small-sample optimism. Statcast says Jansen deserved better -- his xBA was .247 -- and keep in mind he was only 24 years old for most of last season. That being said, Jansen lost the playing-time edge to Reese McGuire in September and his extreme pull tendencies will lead to more teams shifting against him, likely capping his BA. Jansen saw a traditional shift against him in 117 of his PA last year and hit .197 in those situations. He will need to compete to earn the primary catcher role back in spring training."

His second season in San Francisco was a significant improvement on his first, from a real-world perspective, as Longoria raised his walk rate to 8.5% -- his highest mark since 2013. His defense at third base also rebounded. However, his fantasy utility did not match up. Longoria failed to crack even 130 runs-plus-RBI despite hitting mostly 3-5 in the order, and while that is not really ""his fault,"" the team around him isn't any better entering 2020. His rate/power numbers are barely above league average, and he plays a position ripe with power hitters. Longoria has cleared 500 PA in seven consecutive seasons, providing a safe floor that is appealing in NL-only leagues. However, late in mixed-league drafts, most will want to chase upside instead."

It's best to assume at least a short IL stint, which casts a cloud on his role upon activation, problematic especially when coupled with his pro-worst 22.5% strikeout rate in the majors in 2019. Urias is mostly a stash for now, though he's a more intriguing prospect in dynasty leagues."

The defensive wizardry may not count in fantasy, but it will help Perez remain the bell cow if his newfound batting prowess wanes. To wit, heading into the season, he clubbed a meager 21 homers in 963 career trips to the dish. In 2019, he slammed 24 in 449 plate appearances. He'll be hard-pressed to match that total, considering a likely regression to his 28% HR/FB mark, in concert with a 50% ground ball clip, but with volume now part of his profile, Perez should clear the fence enough to remain a fantasy asset despite a low batting average."

He'll get a long look this spring, with second base the more likely destination. A victory in said battle would put him on the (deeper) mixed-league middle-infield radar."

He struck out in 32% of his plate appearances but supplied the second-best SLG of his career (while also walking at a healthy clip), leading to a 103 wRC+. Behind the plate, Castro grades out as a significant plus, although his pop times and framing are just OK by Statcast measures. He missed most of the 2018 season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, but after signing Castro to a one-year, $6.85 million deal, the Angels are hoping he can clear 100 games played in 2020 . He's a batting-average liability, but Castro cracked double-digit homers in six of the last seven seasons. He should do so again with Angels Stadium playing friendlier for lefty power since the boundary in right field was lowered."

That season, Gonzalez hit .303 with 23 home runs and a 144 wRC+. His wRC+ ranged from 89 to 111 in the five seasons surrounding 2017. So, essentially Gonzalez is a league-average bat -- slightly above league average when things are going well -- with his calling card being his ability to play all around the diamond. His time in the middle infield was limited in his first season with the Twins and he has lost second-base and shortstop eligibility entering 2020. Gonzalez maintains eligibility in the outfield and at both corner-infield positions. For a while this winter, Gonzalez sat atop the depth chart at first base by default, but he was always likely to remain in his super-utility role. After the team signed Josh Donaldson, Miguel Sano is now slotted in at first."

His home run output dipped into the teens for the first time in four seasons, and his 70 wRC+ ranked seventh-worst in the league among players with at least 400 PA. Furthermore, Franco's batting average tumbled 36 points to a paltry .234. At first glance, that number seems surprising from a hitter who posted a superb 84.3% contact rate and struck out only 14.3% of the time. However, the low number becomes perfectly rational when considering the 24.1% infield fly ball rate that ranked dead last in the majors -- by more than four percent -- and led to a scant .236 BABIP. Franco will attempt to resurrect his career in Kansas City after signing with the Royals in the offseason, but his body of work to date inspires little confidence in his fantasy viability."

While his power wasn't the same as in his salad days, Frazier hit over 20 homers for the fifth time in six years. Bogged down with 20th-percentile spring speed, Frazier only stole one bag -- noteworthy since sneaky steals used to be an integral aspect of his fantasy contributions. The 34-year old veteran signed with Texas where he'll compete for playing time at both corner infield spots. The move from Citi Field should help Frazier maintain last season's output, though the new Rangers venue isn't expected to play nearly as hitter-friendly as the old one.

This should carry over to his new team. Romine lacks the contact ability needed to hit for a high average and his power isn't close to equaling Sanchez's -- and it's possible that a .270-15 stat line is his 2020 ceiling. Considering the catching pool these days, though, that's probably enough to warrant No. 2 mixed-league status."

That was largely due to a slew of injuries that limited the speedster to just 117 games, his lowest total in three years. Still, Gordon stole fewer bases (22) than he did in his 79-game season in 2016, so injuries weren't solely to blame. After spending the vast majority of his career in the leadoff position (and despite a paltry 4.1 BB%), Gordon logged 79% of his plate appearances in the bottom third of the order last season, resulting in fewer steal attempts when he did reach base. The 31-year-old did hit .331 in 178 at-bats from the No. 9 spot and should continue to be a stolen-base asset, but don't expect him to get anywhere close to the 60-theft mark that was once his norm."

Unfortunately, Barnhart was not one of them, posting an 81 wRC+, which was 22nd among catchers with at least 300 plate appearances. Barnhart's .231 average was his lowest since becoming Cincinnati's primary backstop in 2016. A 12th-percentile average exit velocity working in tandem with a career-worst 22.8% strikeout rate were the culprits. While the Reds improved their position players, they didn't address the catcher position, as they likely expect highly regarded prospect Tyler Stephenson to debut sometime this season. Barnhart should be ignored in single-catcher formats."

He started mostly against right-handed pitching (eight starts vs. LHP) and was a little bit better than league average. Moreland struck out 22.1% of the time while walking at a 10.1% clip -- nearly identical to his 2018 marks. He just could not push past 400 plate appearances again because a right quad strain wiped out a significant chunk of his season. A free agent this winter, Moreland eventually re-upped with the Red Sox on a one-year, $3 million deal. There is nothing exciting about Moreland, now 34, but he's a strong bet to hit 20 home runs if he can stay healthy and remain on the strong side of a platoon all year. The deeper the league, the more appeal Moreland has. Most in mixed leagues will want to chase upside instead, as the type of production Moreland provides is fairly easy to replace in shallower formats."

He has an impatient approach at the plate, leading to few walks and a high strikeout rate thus holding down his batting average and on-base percentages. He does possess decent pop, particularly from the left side, and showcased that last year in Toronto before a late season deal-to Cincinnati. Great American Ballpark presents him with an opportunity to hit 20 homers again if he can stay in the lineup enough. The expected stats are not optimistic about a step forward, but over the past four seasons, Galvis was a productive compiler of counting stats. The glove should keep him in the lineup regularly, and he figures to occupy a spot lower in the batting order."

That low batting average can't be blamed on contact issues, as his 26.7 K% wasn't all that high for a slugger, but instead on his .232 BABIP. If that number gets closer to league average (.298) Vogelbach could produce a respectable batting average to go along with decent power, but his complete lack of speed and his fly-ball profile mean a low BABIP is to be expected. Still, Vogelbach should hit enough homers to offset his low average again this season, and he can now focus exclusively on hitting as the DH with Evan White at first base."

Yet, he held his own in his brief audition. He'll be in the spring 2B competition, his knack for contact perhaps giving him a realistic chance at winning the job. In reality, he could probably use additional Triple-A seasoning. Stash Hoerner in deep-mixed and NL-only leagues, and consider him a high-floor performer in the big-league games he gives you."

A potential option at DH, first base, left field or at third base (in that order of likelihood), he might be capable of duplicating 2019's 25 Triple-A homers at the big-league level if given a chance. That said, his free-swinging ways make a .312 batting average (or anything close to it) a longshot. Mountcastle's skills are more appealing in rotisserie than points leagues, so regard him a stronger stash there."

Normally, this isn't relevant for fantasy but with Reyes, it makes him the most likely candidate to man center field in Motown. His patience needs work to hit leadoff, but Reyes makes decent contact with just enough pop to be dangerous. The team context isn't great for run production, but it's more than commensurate with where you'll likely draft the 25-year old outfielder. Reyes can steal bases, running with 91st-percentile sprint speed. In leagues with daily moves, Reyes is ideally deployed on Monday and Thursday, where you'll hope for some steals while one of your regular outfielders has a travel day."

He's been below the replacement-level threshold by real-world measures for the last three years, hitting between .241-.245 with OBPs between .286-.305. The power is basically league average nowadays and Pujols provides zero value on the defensive side. In fact, he's a negative in the field. To his credit, he did manage to drive in 93 runs last season, tying for 14th in the American League, but it took a .294/.362/.551 line with runners in scoring position to get him there. That's unsustainable and Anthony Rendon may cash in a lot of those baserunners in 2020 while batting behind Mike Trout (but ahead of Pujols) in the batting order. Pujols can be safely left on the waiver wire in most mixed leagues."

Rodgers would struggle to the tune of 22 strikeouts and only two extra-base hits in 65 at-bats, perhaps pressing in his first taste of the majors, beforegoing down with a shoulder impingement that eventually required season-ending surgery in July. When healthy, Rodgers has a strong balance of contact ability, pop and speed, equally appealing in both rotisserie and points-based leagues. He could be a dynasty pickup on the cheap."

Peraza's 42.6% fly ball rate was far too high, resulting in easy outs, even in The Great American Bandbox. In addition, Peraza walked only 4.2% of the time, limiting the ability to take advantage of his primary skill, 75th percentile sprint speed. With no place for him in their revamped infield, Cincinnati non-tendered Peraza, freeing him up to sign with the Red Sox, with whom he'll compete for playing time at the keystone. Even if he wins the job, his production won't warrant anything other than end-game attention in AL-only formats."

Right after the deal became official, Andrew McCutchen tore his ACL, thrusting Bruce into a starting role. He posted a .221/.235/.510 line for the Phillies, walking just three times in 149 plate appearances. The injury bug also bit Bruce as he missed about six weeks with two IL stints, first for a sore oblique, then a flexor strain. Bruce's extreme fly ball approach was good for power but overall poor plate skills (24.7% K-rate, 5.7% BB-rate) and a .200 BABIP crushed both his average and OBP. Bruce is expected to back up corner outfield and first base, but could factor as the Phillies' designated hitter if McCutchen is prepared to serve as an everyday outfielder. Stay tuned."

He began the year batting leadoff vs. RHP but lost that spot a couple weeks into the season and never reclaimed the table-setter role for Atlanta. His increased pull tendencies continued, and his strikeout rate ticked up to 17.8%, leading to another dip in batting average, which slipped 58 points during the last two years. However, on account of raising his walk rate nearly four percentage points to 11.3%, Inciarte's overall offensive performance stayed within his career norms in OPS and wRC+. His running was limited around the injuries, and he's not assured of a starting role after the team signed Marcell Ozuna. Remember, too, that the Braves have two top outfield prospects (Cristian Pache and Drew Waters) waiting in the wings."

That's essentially the pace he was on last year in his first season with the Mariners, but he was limited to 93 games by ankle and hamstring injuries. As a plus defensively at shortstop, Crawford was able to provide some real-life value to Seattle, but at this point it's looking like the former top prospect will never hit enough to be relevant outside of AL/NL-only formats. Virtually nothing in the batted-ball profile suggests there's more to come; his average exit velocity and hard-hit rate both ranked in the bottom 6% of the league, and he has totaled 13 barrels (by Statcast's definition) on 399 batted-ball events in the big leagues.

It's possible that his poor 2019 audition with the Marlins provided him the requisite experience to now improve. He had major issues with contact, but continued to show a fly ball-heavy, contact-driven, three-true-outcomes sort of approach. It's one that might result in a sneaky-good number of homers . Remember, the Marlins did move in the RF fences for 2020. Consider him a deep-mixed/NL-only flier, but one with high variance."

Cabrera hit just .235/.318/.393 over the first four months of 2019 and the Rangers designated him for assignment. Not only were they unable to find a trade partner, but no team was even willing to claim Cabrera off waivers even though he was only making $3.5 million for the entire season. After his unconditional release, Cabrera immediately signed with Washington, and the rest is history. Cabrera hit .323/.404/.565 in 38 games for the Nationals over the remainder of the regular season and went on to hit .286 in the World Series while starting five games. The Nats brought him back after their championship season and will likely slot Cabrera in at third base, with Starlin Castro at second. Cabrera will have third-base and second-base eligibility on draft day and the switch-hitter's floor still looks pretty sturdy."

While not a marquee prospect, Lopez had real buzz as a minor leaguer and there was some thought that he could steal double-digit bases while hitting for a high average. Some things did translate, with Lopez posting a low 12.7 K% in his 402 plate appearances with Kansas City. Unfortunately, that was the only skill to carry over, as Lopez could not tap into the gap power he showed at Triple-A. He struggled with plate patience, with his BB% falling from 14.5% to just 4.5% after the jump in levels. Worst of all for those who took the chance, Lopez hardly ran at all, swiping just one bag in two attempts with the major-league team. On the plus side, with Whit Merrifield moving to the outfield full time, second base looks it may be Lopez's to lose, at least."

He managed 16 homers over 384 PA after hitting just seven in 334 opportunities the previous year, but his average dropped from .299 to .269, his BB% fell from 14.7 to 9.9 and his K% rose from 13.8 to 15.6. Even the positive development in his power numbers comes with caveats, as his fly ball rate, barrel rate, exit velocity and launch angle all dropped. He's still a decent hitter, but after finishing the year with a lengthy injury-related absence for the second straight season and with new competition for at-bats in the form of Nick Castellanos and Shogo Akiyama, he's a risky bet."

He battled some injuries of his own -- a left calf strain and a left wrist issue -- but performed well when on the field. At 32 years old, Maybin posted an 11.2 BB% and bested his previous career high in ISO by 50 points. His .285 batting average was his second-best mark in a full season, although it took a .365 BABIP to get there. After stealing 33 bases just three seasons ago, Maybin swiped just nine last year, with diminished efficiency (9-for-15). As of late January, Maybin remains unsigned, but the No. 10 overall pick from the 2005 draft showed he can still provide value on a big-league bench and should land a major-league job. The expanded rosters afforded in 2020 helps a fifth-outfielder-type like Maybin stick around."

While he set a professional best with his 11 home runs in 2019, let's remember the context of the homer-happy baseball, as the remainder of his game had the same ordinary look as it did in his five seasons with the Tigers. Iglesias can help an AL-only team thanks to the counting numbers he provides, but he's severely lacking in upside."

Three games into the season he was shelved with a calf issue, returning for just a game before heading back to the IL after being hit in the hand. Cooper was activated in mid-May and avoiding the injury bug until a knee issue shut him down in mid-September. On the field, Cooper posted a 111 wRC+, consistent with a productive minor-league career. His 23.8% HR/FB mark was well above league average, but a low 23% flyball rate and high 26.1% strikeout rate limited production. It's unclear where Cooper will play as Miami brought in several veterans. The most likely spot is sharing first base with Jesus Aguilar, though the right-handed-swinging Cooper fared much better against right-handed pitching last season."

He enjoyed a power breakthrough in the upper minors in 2019, hitting 19 homers in 99 games combined between Double- and Triple-A, and added 24 steals to give him additional rotisserie appeal. Track that position battle throughout July, as Fraley would be well worth an AL-only late round pick if he's the victor, and he might even scratch the mixed-league radar in the best case scenario."

Unfortunately, he could not build on his strong campaign and instead took a sizable step backward in his age-27 season. His gains against right-handed pitching were washed away, with Hernandez batting just .221/.285/.403 without the platoon edge (down from .252/.338/.495 vs. RHP in 2018). His strikeout and walk rates both went in the wrong direction by three-plus percentage points while his barrel rate sagged to 5.9%. To his credit, Hernandez remained a plus on defense and provided versatility with his ability to play all around the diamond. However, it is important to note that Hernandez has lost shortstop eligibility entering 2020. Given his decline and the emergence of uber-prospect Gavin Lux at second base, Hernandez appears likely to see a reduction in playing time this season."

By the time he made it back onto the field, Christian Walker had put his stamp on the first base job and Eduardo Escobar continued to hold down the hot corner. With that, Lamb was relegated to part-time duty -- and that role was scaled back even further in September amidst a prolonged slump. Lamb can take a walk, however, and he hit the ball hard in his limited play last year, not to mention he might be a fit as the Diamondbacks' new designated hitter. Kevin Cron and/or Josh Rojas could also factor into that mix, so be cautious regarding Lamb anything more than a fantasy backup for now."

He failed to take advantage and was shipped to Triple-A Buffalo in July. Tellez regained his stroke on the farm and hit an improved, but still pedestrian, 226/.325/.481 down the stretch. Poor plate skills (28.4% K% and 7.1% BB%) hurt Tellez as his 80th percentile average exit velocity and 68th percentile hard-hit rate are acceptable. The Blue Jays have several options at first base and designated hitter, so it will take a strong camp with improved on-base skills for Tellez to carve out a fantasy-friendly role."

He slashed .289/.421/.508 in 93 games for Triple-A Durham, but in a 50-game taste of the majors, only the pop translated. For Lowe to break through, he'll need to recapture that prior patience, and he'll have a harder time doing so on a Rays team that added Jose Martinez and Yoshitomo Tsutsugo to the first base/DH mix. Consider Lowe a deep mixed/AL-only stash, barring a lights-out spring."

After slugging .597 in 44 games to close out the 2018 campaign, gravity spiraled O'Hearn back to earth last year as he posted a disappointing .195/.281/.369 line, falling into a platoon by season's end. O'Hearn's Statcast measurables were down last season but, to be fair, that's not enough to account for the precipitous drop in performance. This suggests a combination of good luck in 2018 and bad luck last season. The acquisition of Maikel Franco frees up Hunter Dozier to move across the diamond. However, Dozier can also move to corner outfield, so O'Hearn needs a strong spring to return to his platoon playing time. Regardless, there are better options in mixed leagues."

He provided solid defense, which is probably the basis for his entering spring training the favorite for center field duties (at least against righties), though a good Grapefruit League campaign would be needed before he's anything more than NL-only material."

While Camargo's underlying metrics did slip a bit last season, it wasn't nearly enough to account for the slide in overall numbers. To wit, in 2018, his wOBA was .346, well over his .310 Statcast expected mark. Last season, his expected wOBA was .282, lower than the previous season, but he posted an actual .279, in line with Statcast's estimation. The message is he was lucky in 2018, with the logical baseline in line with 2019. Unfortunately, that's not fantasy-friendly production, and Camargo would need to emerge as a regular at third base to be relevant in deeper leagues."

He's never going to be much of a power hitter, so his nine home runs were in line with expectations, but his .275 batting average was slightly disappointing, considering the Coors Field factor and his career .319 minor-league mark. Tapia's nine stolen bases were also a mild disappointment, as he possesses excellent speed and has swiped as many as 33 bags in a minor-league season. To take advantage of his speed, Tapia would be well-served to reach base by any means, but he has thus far showed an aversion to taking walks, and he registered a paltry 4.7 BB% last season. Tapia has the skills to be an above-average hitter and contribute in the increasingly elusive stolen-base department, but a crowded outfield may block his path to a starting role in 2020."

The boost in playing time helped alleviate any concerns about declining speed as he approaches this, his age-35, season. After all, his new deal with the Pirates probably assures him a similarly large role as their center fielder. Dyson is unfortunately a one-trick pony, there in the late rounds as a mere safety net if you left your team light on stolen bases. In points-based leagues, you can freely move on."

Still, neither stat jumps off the page, and the two-time All-Star finished with an 82 wRC+ that ranked third worst among qualified second basemen. Kipnis still makes good contact -- he posted an 80.8% contact rate last season -- but his tendency to put the ball in the air (41.2 FB%), coupled with a below-average 5.5% barrel rate and a mediocre 86.7 mph average exit velocity, led to frequent outs. Kipnis was a lock for 20-plus stolen bases earlier in his career, but he has not reached double digits in that category since 2016, further limiting his fantasy value. He'll get a fresh start playing somewhere other than Cleveland for the first time in 2020, but there's no guarantee he will have an everyday role."

That trade fell through, however, so Goodwin remains atop the depth chart in right field -- for now. Goodwin quietly had a pretty nice year in 2019, hitting 17 homers while stealing seven bases, but he's a soon-to-be 30-year-old with a career .255/.320/.461 line at the big-league level. That's perfectly fine for a reserve outfielder, but not for a starting corner outfielder on a contending team, which is what the Angels fancy themselves in 2020. Top prospect Jo Adell looms as a threat to take Goodwin's job, possibly as soon as late April. Goodwin would probably need another long-term Justin Upton injury to remain relevant throughout the year. However, as a reserve, he should fall into enough playing time to be useful in AL-only leagues."

He suffered a freak injury last year when he fouled a ball off his groin, rupturing a testicle. While rehabbing, Haniger's back became sore, he did not respond well to treatment, and the Mariners eventually gave up hope for a September return. In late September, it was reported that Haniger would not have any restrictions this spring, but Haniger was ultimately forced to undergo hernia surgery in late January. It was estimated that he'd need 6-to-8 weeks to recover, though GM Jerry Dipoto would not commit to that timetable. With Opening Day in doubt, and after a significant strikeout rate spike in his age-28 season to 28.6%, Haniger is a true wild card. In mixed leagues without IL spots, he's borderline. At least we know he'll play when (if?) he gets healthy."

He ended up faring quite well at the plate with Seattle in his 79 games split between first base, second, third, catcher and the outfield, cracking 10 homers and posting a 114 wRC+ over 267 PA. Unfortunately, only seven of his appearances came behind the plate, so Nola has lost catcher eligibility in most fantasy leagues heading into 2020. If he had maintained C-eligibility, or if he were to regain it in-season, Nola could return to relevance, as he would project to play just enough in his utility role to be useful at a thin position. He's not really viable anywhere else in a starting fantasy lineup. Nola had never slugged even .400 at any stop in the minors before last year and Statcast says he was out over his skis in the majors, given the batted-ball numbers."

He has long been considered a good-not-great prospect with decent pop, but the warning signs were evident: .351 BABIP with his 38.7% big-league strikeout rate hinting huge batting average downside, and mediocre-at-best ground ball and hard-contact rates. Lewis has some adjustments to make while he battles for a starting outfield spot in the spring, and he's mostly a final-round dart throw or dynasty mid-to-late rounder for now."

He admitted last September he was pondering retirement but ultimately re-upped with the Royals on a one-year deal. At age 35, Gordon cut his strikeout rate to a career-low 15.8% after it got as high as 29.2% a few seasons back. He also maintained a respectable walk rate and raised his OBP to .345 -- his highest mark since 2015. However, he hit just .266 even with all that contact, and given his middling batted-ball numbers, there's likely only one direction for that average to go this season. His decline in speed as he's pushed into his mid-30s has hurt in that regard -- Gordon's BABIP did not top .301 in the last four years -- as well as in regard to his value on the basepaths (5-for-8 on SB attempts in 2018). There is not a shred of upside here and the floor could drop out."

He returned in September and hit .305, but 22 strikeouts in 68 plate appearances during that span should temper enthusiasm. His overall numbers without the platoon edge were ugly (.536 OPS), and while Guzman is still relatively young at 25, it does not seem the Rangers are optimistic about Guzman finding another level to his game. They brought in Todd Frazier on a one-year deal, and Frazier projects to see a good amount of time at first base, with Nick Solak playing some at third. With that, Guzman loses whatever appeal he had outside of AL-only leagues."

While his role allowed him to provide fantasy owners 93 runs in 2019, don't expect a repeat of that this year. The retooled White Sox look to be pushing for a playoff spot and likely don't want a bat as weak as Garcia's hitting atop the order. It's quite likely Garcia loses his starting role altogether, as highly-touted center-field prospect Luis Robert signed an extension in January, presumably paving the way for him to occupy a spot in the Opening Day lineup. Garcia's ability to play both center field and shortstop should keep him around in a bench capacity, but he won't do much other than provide the occasional steal if injuries open up extra playing time."

Flores wasn't limited at the plate, as he set new career bests in average and on-base percentage, falling .001 points short of tying his personal high slugging percentage. A 5% shift from fly balls to line drives buoyed Flores' average, while the 2019 fun ball helped keep the power afloat in light of reduced fly balls. Now with the Giants, expect Flores to revert to previous performance levels in a less-hitter-friendly venue, though he has a chance to surpass last season's 89 games and 265 plate appearances."

Zunino's contact actually improved a couple points, but a drop in average exit velocity and more fly balls doesn't sync up with the cavernous space in Tropicana Field. Still, after swatting 45 homers from 2017-2018, Zunino deserves a little benefit of the doubt. A power return is likely and, with d'Arnaud gone, Zunino should regain the starting job. The middle portion of the catcher ranks has improved, but the back end remains dreadful.

When the recipient is a 34-year-old catcher, it's basically assumed home runs will wane. Just the opposite occurred with Vogt, as he crushed his career bests in ISO and slugging percentage, playing half his games in Oracle Park, no less. A modest increase in fly balls along with a marked leap in average exit velocity did the trick. Vogt parlayed his rejuvenated season into a one-year deal with the Diamondbacks , with whom he'll serve as Carson Kelly's understudy. Beware, Kelly is maturing at the dish and in the field, so Vogt is likely to fall short of last season's 280 plate appearances, relegating him to fantasy status only in deep two-catcher formats."

After the lost season, Arizona declined to tender Souza a contract for 2020, making him a free agent. In December, reports surfaced saying Souza had been hitting, running and throwing at 100 percent. A little over a month later, Souza finalized a one-year, major-league deal with the Cubs. As the roster stands, Souza appears to be on the outside looking, but he's best suited for short-side platoon duty anyway. He has been below league average by wRC+ in three of his five seasons, and has been significantly above league average only once (121 wRC+ in 2017).

By season's end, Sogard shattered his career high in homers while also setting a new personal-best in slugging percentage. His exit velocity on fly balls and average fly ball distance were both well below the league average, but his spray chart shows that Sogard hit almost all his homers down the line where the fence is closer. He should benefit from returning to Miller Park, though there's no guarantee he'll be fortunate enough to pull so many fly balls.

The Padres assigned the 29-year old outfielder to Triple-A El Paso where slashed .360/.462/.593, earning a 2019 promotion in early May. He played sparingly before spending time on the IL with a sore wrist. Dickerson was then dealt to the Giants, where he slashed an impressive .386/.449.773, facing mainly right-handers before being shelved due to an oblique issue. After returning, Dickerson couldn't find his stroke, compiling just a .164/.219/.209 line down the stretch. The Giants saw enough to bring Dickerson back in 2020.

He even swiped six bags in seven tries -- not bad for a 36-year old veteran still running with 85th-percentile sprint speed. That said, Pence once again was felled by the injury bug.

Upon closer inspection, his average exit velocity on fly balls increased 3 mph, while his ground ball and line drive components dropped. The result was a spike in power but a precipitous drop in line drive and ground ball hits since only 28% of Almora's contact was classified as a fly ball. If Almora didn't have such a long track record of a low fly ball percentage, he'd be a candidate for continued power growth.

Instead, the 29-year-old was hampered by a string of injuries that resulted in three trips to the IL and limited him to 263 plate appearances. When he did play, Wendle looked nothing like the .300 hitter from his breakout campaign. He finished the season with a .231 average and .275 wOBA while posting the lowest walk rate (5.3%) of his career. It's fair to assume that the injuries played a part in his struggles, and Wendle should get some leeway after posting solid averages throughout his professional career.

He improved his hard-hit rate, but it was still just 18th-percentile. Hedges lofted more batted balls, but since they were weakly hit, they resulted in outs. This was particularly true in Petco Park where Hedges' numbers were worse than on the road. The 27-year-old receiver remains one of the best behind the dish, setting a new personal best with 22 defensive runs saved.

In some cases, it can be a detriment, as fly balls staying in the yard result in fewer hits than ground balls. In 2019, Barnes increased his fly ball rate from 26% to 42%, but his average exit velocity on fly balls dropped from 89.8 mph to 88.4 mph, while his average fly ball distance fell from 326.9 feet to 303.5 feet. In addition, Barnes' plate skills took a step back, as he whiffed more and walked less, costing him his starting job and resulting in a visit to the farm. Barnes is slated to back up Will Smith, but unless he reverts to old form or refines his current approach, he's not relevant in any fantasy format."

The 2018 Double-A batting champion was slashing .355/.408/.591 when he received the call to report to South Beach. Ramirez compiled a respectable .276/.312/.416 slash in his rookie campaign, playing nearly every day in the outfield. A 14.5% HR/FB rate is above league average, but a 23% flyball rate limited Ramirez's ability to tap into that power. However, 92nd percentile spring speed along with a 57% groundball rate helped prop up a .328 batting average on balls in play. Unfortunately, Ramirez didn't take full advantage of his speed, stealing only two bases. After the Marlins brought in a few veterans, it appears Ramirez is ticketed for a reserve role, though an injury to any one of several players could return Ramirez to the starting lineup."

Instead, the left-hander's strikeout rate actually increased to 27.2% last season. That's not good for a hitter who has displayed only moderate power (.163 career ISO) and who doesn't awe observers with any specific skill. Bauers does possess some speed -- he stole 20 bases in the minors in 2017 -- but he has thus far proved to be a detriment on the basepaths at the major league level, getting thrown out in half of his 18 theft attempts. His best offensive asset is his ability to draw a walk (career 12.2 BB%), but that's unlikely to earn him a full-time role unless he fixes his contact issues and better taps into his raw power."

His 95.8% contact rate in the majors represented the ninth consecutive pro campaign in which that number was 95%-plus, giving him a batting average floor that makes him a wise No. 2 catcher -- he's still eligible there -- if you opt to go the cheap route at the position.

However, doctors deemed it safe for Cervelli to continue squatting behind the dish. He began the season with the Pirates before getting concussed in May. Many thought Cervelli would retire after getting let go in August, but Cervelli and the Braves had other plans. The 33-year-old receiver finished the season with Atlanta but was released after the playoffs. Cervelli signed with the Marlins, with whom he'll back up Jorge Alfaro.

Despite the struggles, the Brewers still decided to bring him back for another season rather than not tender him a contract. He won't have the shortstop spot all to himself like he did in the past, as the Brewers acquired Luis Urias from the Padres in an effort to get more offense at the position. Urias could miss the start of the season due to a hand injury, so Arcia could still find himself in the lineup come Opening Day. However, everyday at-bats could be hard to come by when both are healthy, and Arcia will likely need that in order to be of much help for fantasy players."

An ankle issue cost Frazier 11 games, he struck out 43 times in his next 123 at-bats and was returned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he remained for all but a September call-up in a reserve role. We've now been waiting three seasons for this �top prospect� to flourish, and his walk and hard-contact drops in 2019 were troubling.

The speedster stole eight bases in April despite a paltry .298 OBP, but things went downhill from there, as nagging injuries and poor on-base skills led to the Royals releasing Hamilton in mid-August after hitting an anemic .211/.275/.269 and stealing 17 bags in 22 tries. The Braves claimed Hamilton and used him sparingly down the stretch, though he did improve his decimals to .268/.375/.317 with Atlanta and stole another four bases.

He was pacing towards a season similar to the previous campaign before a hip issue in late May ended up costing Healy the rest of the season. Healy's 21% strikeout rate is palatable in today's landscape, but he doesn't hit the ball hard enough to support a 44% fly ball rate, resulting in too many cans of corn.

Taylor's numbers weren't far from his career levels, but they weren't good enough for the eventual World Series champions. Taylor's 46% ground ball approach is good for a player with 92nd percentile spring speed, but he fails to supplement it, sporting a 7% walk rate and a strikeout rate consistently north of 30%.

Cincinnati let Kemp go before he was fully healthy. The veteran outfielder caught on with the Mets but was released before playing a game. Once he recovered, Kemp worked out on his own, signing a minor-league deal with the Marlins where he'll try to break camp as a reserve. Entering his age-35 season, Kemp is a longshot to make the bigs, let alone be fantasy relevant."

Back then, he exhibited plate skills beyond his 18 years, but as he progressed, he's been unable to maintain them, let alone develop in other areas. Last season, McKinney broke camp with the Blue Jays but was shuttled to Triple-A Buffalo three times before ending the season in Toronto. Contact and walks were once his calling card, but last season, he fanned at a 26.4% clip while walking just 6.9% of the time. The Blue Jays are assembling a formidable offense. If McKinney wants to be a part, he'll need to ratchet up his on-base skills."

When healthy, he was assigned to Triple-A Sacramento before being recalled again in early August. Duggar was back for only a week when he hurt his shoulder diving in the outfield. Surgery wasn't necessary, but the injury shut Duggar down for the season. He is expected to be ready for spring training. On the field, Duggar posted a 64 wRC+, the 14th-lowest among non-catchers with at least 250 plate appearances. Add in his 1-for-5 record in stealing bases and Duggar was one of the worst fantasy performers in the sport. Duggar's prospects aren't much better for the upcoming season. His strikeout rate is high while his quality of contact is poor. There's nothing to see here in all but the deepest of formats."

To be fair, during the previous two seasons, he recorded 69 and 39 marks, so he was trending in the right direction. Still, with the South Siders upgrading their offense, Engel's chance for significant playing time has waned. In particular, Engel's 31% career strikeout rate and 5% walk rate are both poor, relegating him to reserve outfielder status, if he makes the team at all."

He slashed .283/.343/.413, but finished on a high note, batting .319/.371/.496 with five homers over his final 28 games. Kirilloff will probably begin the year at Triple-A, and if he continues to excel at making contact with his line-drive stroke, he might see some time in Minnesota by midseason. He's one of the better dynasty-league prospects and warrants a stash in deep-mixed/AL-only leagues."

However, injuries and aging instigated a sharp decline, as Cozart posted an anemic .124/.178/.144 line in 38 games for the Angels last season before succumbing to a shoulder injury that required season-ending surgery. The Halos packaged Cozart and prospect Will Wilson to the Giants to get out from under Cozart's contract, but San Francisco released the 34-year-old shortstop. The addition of a 26th roster spot could help Cozart land a job. However, there aren't ample enough fantasy roster spots to include Cozart."

The Athletics acquired Fowler as part of the Sonny Gray deal, but he was quickly passed up by Ramon Laureano on the depth chart. Fowler spent the entire 2019 season on the farm, hitting .277/.333/.477 for Triple-A Las Vegas and swiping a dozen bags. Las Vegas is one of the best hitting venues in the minors and Triple-A used the same ball as the majors, though, so Fowler's production wasn't enough to warrant a promotion to The Show. Oakland continues carrying a deep roster, which has Fowler ticketed for another season riding buses, hoping to rekindle the promise he exhibited in the lower minors."

In 2017, Schebler blasted 30 homers for the Reds. Last season, he was slashing .123/.253/.222 before Cincinnati sent him to Triple-A Louisville where he posted a .216/.274/.325 line. There's a saying stating once you display a skill, you own it. The thing is, once you display lack of a skill, you own that too. Schebler's skills are poor across the board: high strikeouts, a low average exit velocity, and a huge groundball tilt all dampen power. Maybe he will rediscover his stroke, but it's not worth investing any draft capital to find out."

Over the past three seasons, his .286 BA and .415 SLG were nearly identical to his career marks, and advanced metrics suggest little change from his days in Baltimore. Markakis was slowed by a fractured wrist last season but still put up a .300 xBA while registering his typical low strikeout rate (12.6%) and high walk rate (10.0%). The 14-year veteran also ranked above the 80th percentile in both average exit velocity (91.2 mph) and hard-hit rate (41.0%), though he launched only nine home runs due to a meager 27.1% fly ball rate and 7.3 degree average launch angle. Therein lies the rub with Markakis -- for all his useful contact and on-base skills, it has been a while since he produced enough in the counting stats to be more than a fringe fantasy asset. Expect more of the same in 2020."

Behind the plate, Posey is still an excellent receiver, which guarantees him extra playing time and the ability to provide more production than the average catcher when on the field. A healthy Posey contributes to batting average and good run production for the catching position, but we have not seen the complete version of him since 2017. The declining exit velocity and increasing groundball rate provide little reason to believe there is a bounce-back season on the way. He was once a lock as a top-10 catcher, but even taking him in the top 15 in 2020 feels like a reach, given his lack of upside."
Ian Desmond,OF,Rockies,443.0,64.0,20.0,65.0,34.0,119.0,3.0,0.255,0.31,0.479,0.7879999999999999,,,,,,,,,,,,"In 2019, Desmond's ground ball rate dropped significantly to 47%, but that's still too high to take advantage of Coors Field -- not just for power but also for hits. Further, Desmond's sprint speed was just 65th percentile, down from 89th in 2016. Losing a couple of steps didn't affect Desmond's infield hits, as a jump in softly hit grounders made it easier to beat more out. But after averaging 20 steals over the previous nine seasons, Desmond attempted only six in 2019, with just three successful tries. As he enters his age-34 season, a return to previous levels seems highly unlikely. Although he has two years left on his contract, Desmond's lack of power and speed and the emergence of some young talent could send him to the bench more than usual. Even so, playing in Coors Field makes him viable, especially in leagues that allow for daily lineup moves."
